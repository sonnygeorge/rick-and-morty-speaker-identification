| Uh, yeah, just a few more design notes.  Um, this guy. The, uh... The, uh... | Morty | Rick |
| Uh, what? It was your job, Morty. | Rick | Summer |
| Oh, God, whatâ€™s going on now? | Summer | Beth |
| He bails on everybody! He bailed on Mom when she was a kid! He -- He bailed on tiny planet! And in case I never made this clear to you, Summer, he bailed on you. He left you to rot in a world that he ruined because he doesn't care! Because nobody's special to him, Summer, not even himself. So, if you really want your grandpa back, grab a shovel. The one that won't let you down is buried in your backyard! | Summer | Morty |
| I'll cover that bet. I get it. | Rick | Morty |
| Boy, you really got me up against a wall this time, Jerry. | Beth | Rick |
| Because you suck! You've been keeping your lip zipped about it since Grandpa got arrested, but the fact is, you're freaking stoked to bail on him. | Rick | Summer |
| Hey! I said nobody move, buddy! | Morty | Rick |
| Me. I used to wear blue pants. | Morty | Rick |
| But can you help me get to my family? You know, at my house? | Beth | Morty |
| I would have been happy to pay for it, Summer, but they don't exactly sell them at Costco. Besides, there's a larger lesson to be learned here. Get him! | Beth | Rick |
| Alright! That's enough. You're talking about my species! We understand genocide, we do it sometimes! | Morty | Jerry |
| I am not putting my father in a home! He just came back into my life, and you want to grab him and stuff him under a mattress like last month's Victoria's Secret? | Rick | Beth |
| Morty, Mom's talking. I'm sorry, I suppose that's a good segue into our little discipline cases here. | Rick | Beth |
| Yes I will! That's right, assholes, take my penis, TAKE IT ALL! And tell Shrimply Pimples that when the galaxy came calling Jerry Smith from Earth didn't flinch! | Summer | Jerry |
| You donâ€™t have to be a dick. | Jerry | Rick |
| I am sad that I peed. I'm sad that I peed in class instead of a toilet. | Rick | Morty |
| Hello? Is anybody here?  Mr. President! | Summer | Morty |
| I'm sorry. It's just like the end of "Old Yeller. | Morty | Jerry |
| It's the Citadel of Ricks. All the different Ricks from all the different realities got together to hide here from the government. | Rick | Morty |
| How is praying going to help? | Summer | Beth |
| You don't need to say anything. We got you, dawg. | Rick | Morty |
| Aw! Oh, my God! He recognizes the other dogs on TV. | Morty | Summer |
| I don't know yet. I'll make it up as I go. That's what Grandpa Rick does. That's what heroes do. | Morty | Summer |
| Hey, what's wrong Morty? Oh, you're worried about your dad, huh? | Beth | Rick |
| Morty, stay out of this. You are obviously not capable of judging these situations on your own. | Rick | Jerry |
| I mean it's been shot. With a gun. | Morty | Beth |
| No idea what you're talking about. | Jerry | Rick |
| Sure thing! And I was kinda hoping that I could get a selfie with you? | Rick | Morty |
| Really? You don't say. You would have used a ghost train?  Hey, everybody, the ghost train guy would have used a ghost train! | Morty | Rick |
| Boom! Told you! In your face! He is ruining our child! Wait, what am I celebrating? | Morty | Jerry |
| Jerry, this was the most romantic weekend I've ever had. | Rick | Beth |
| Summer, listen carefully. I stole a paper clip and I have it in my cheek but I donâ€™t know what to do with it and it hurts. | Rick | Jerry |
| Grandpa Rick wouldn't put up with this! | Morty | Summer |
| Goldenfold, we're coming out! We just want to talk! | Summer | Rick |
| He got wrapped up in an experiment. He's a scientist. Like, legit, like on an inter-galactic, sci-fi level. His work is very -- | Rick | Beth |
| I don't know. I think like one sixty-fourth of my collars didn't work. It's hard to keep straight now that I have sixty-three other memories of everything. | Rick | Morty |
| - or sister I said any of this, I'll deny it - | Morty | Rick |
| Uh, w-why don't you get it Jerry? you're the man of the house and you don't have a job. | Morty | Rick |
| Well, I'm not calling him that. That's ridiculous. | Rick | Jerry |
| I didn't say my father is perfect, I said his work is important. | Jerry | Beth |
| Sure. Why not? I donâ€™t, I don't know. Y-you know what, Moâ€” | Morty | Rick |
| Nobody needs anything! Okay, it's fine. I mean, you should just stay here and figure out how to stop being a pickle, okay? | Rick | Beth |
| We're miserable, Morty! There's a mandatory curfew, their weird calendar made me 47, and they weaponized the Eiffel Tower! | Rick | Summer |
| Seems like you guys need some privacy. I'll, uh -- I'll be in the garage. | Jerry | Rick |
| Don't praise him now, Morty! He just peed on the carpet! Bad dog! Bad! | Rick | Jerry |
| And then Ethan played guitar and we learned the Seven Contemplations of the Head by singing them. It was really fun. Praise be the head! | Morty | Summer |
| And Iâ€˜m lucky to have you and I never tell you that! You know, we will come out of this stronger as a family! | Morty | Beth |
| Then what good was the "yes"? | Jerry | Beth |
| So what are you thinking, like, Smokey's Tavern? Maybe Shoney's? | Jerry | Beth |
| What? What kind of monster are you? | Rick | Morty |
| Weâ€™ll take our chances raising her without fancy new jobs outside of a potato-based religion.  And you know what? Iâ€™m sick of pretending that weâ€™re together because of the kids in the first place! I married you because youâ€™re the love of my life! | Summer | Jerry |
| I'm looking at her. Thanks for F.D.'ing me up like that. | Rick | Jerry |
| Huh, what do you know, it's working | Jerry | Rick |
| I never said I was angry at you. | Morty | Summer |
| Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on, Vance. He said you'd die if you tried to leave. That means there's booby traps. | Morty | Rick |
| What? Why are you looking at me? You want to go outside? Outside? | Beth | Jerry |
| This article says the reason we weren't involved was... "personality conflicts". | Rick | Morty |
| Doesn't feel so good, does it? | Jerry | Morty |
| I AM a baby! Iâ€™m a baby NOW! | Morty | Jerry |
| Oldest Rick trick in the book. | Morty | Rick |
| Listen, Rick, if you're gonna stay here rent-free and use my son for your stupid science, the least you could do is put a little bit of it to use for the family. You make that dog smart or Morty's grounded! | Rick | Jerry |
| Alan, I'm not proud of what's happening here, but if you keep coming at me, there's gonna be another passenger on that ghost train. | Beth | Rick |
| Hey, I can't help if I can't see. | Beth | Rick |
| There is no helicopter and there is no Cervine Institute. | Beth | Jerry |
| What?! Why would you -- Look, we're running late. We have to go. | Morty | Beth |
| But I obviously sort of love you, don't I?  So stop asking and maybe I'll love you more.  Crap, They need me at the horse hospital. | Jerry | Beth |
| Yeah, and what's courageous about eating a hot dog? | Jerry | Morty |
| Now hold on a second, letâ€™s be rational about this. | Rick | Beth |
