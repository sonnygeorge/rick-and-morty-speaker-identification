| Uh, yeah, just a few more design notes.  Um, this guy. The, uh... The, uh... | Jerry | Rick |
| Uh, what? It was your job, Morty. | Rick | Summer |
| Oh, God, whatâ€™s going on now? | Summer | Beth |
| He bails on everybody! He bailed on Mom when she was a kid! He -- He bailed on tiny planet! And in case I never made this clear to you, Summer, he bailed on you. He left you to rot in a world that he ruined because he doesn't care! Because nobody's special to him, Summer, not even himself. So, if you really want your grandpa back, grab a shovel. The one that won't let you down is buried in your backyard! | Jerry | Morty |
| Don't worry about Jerry. He's gonna be fine.You hear me Jerry? You're gonna be fine! | Beth | Rick |
| Whoa! Look! It's that lady with all that shit on her face like Worf from Star Trek! That was getting coffee! How did she get there! | Rick | Morty |
| Hey! I said nobody move, buddy! | Morty | Rick |
| Me. I used to wear blue pants. | Morty | Rick |
| I would have been happy to pay for it, Summer, but they don't exactly sell them at Costco. Besides, there's a larger lesson to be learned here. Get him! | Jerry | Rick |
| Morty, Mom's talking. I'm sorry, I suppose that's a good segue into our little discipline cases here. | Rick | Beth |
| Yeah, we missed you so much. Too much to hug you though. | Rick | Summer |
| Yes I will! That's right, assholes, take my penis, TAKE IT ALL! And tell Shrimply Pimples that when the galaxy came calling Jerry Smith from Earth didn't flinch! | Rick | Jerry |
| You donâ€™t have to be a dick. | Morty | Rick |
| I am sad that I peed. I'm sad that I peed in class instead of a toilet. | Rick | Morty |
| I'm sorry. It's just like the end of "Old Yeller. | Rick | Jerry |
| It's the Citadel of Ricks. All the different Ricks from all the different realities got together to hide here from the government. | Rick | Morty |
| How is praying going to help? | Summer | Beth |
| You don't need to say anything. We got you, dawg. | Rick | Morty |
| Aw! Oh, my God! He recognizes the other dogs on TV. | Morty | Summer |
| I don't know yet. I'll make it up as I go. That's what Grandpa Rick does. That's what heroes do. | Morty | Summer |
| Okay, with all due respect, Rickâ€” what am I talking about? What respect is due? How is my son supposed to pass his classes if you keep dragging him off for high-concept Sci-Fi rigamarole? | Morty | Jerry |
| Morty, stay out of this. You are obviously not capable of judging these situations on your own. | Rick | Jerry |
| I mean it's been shot. With a gun. | Morty | Beth |
| No idea what you're talking about. | Morty | Rick |
| Sure thing! And I was kinda hoping that I could get a selfie with you? | Jerry | Morty |
| Really? You don't say. You would have used a ghost train?  Hey, everybody, the ghost train guy would have used a ghost train! | Jerry | Rick |
| Summer, listen carefully. I stole a paper clip and I have it in my cheek but I donâ€™t know what to do with it and it hurts. | Morty | Jerry |
| Grandpa Rick wouldn't put up with this! | Morty | Summer |
| Goldenfold, we're coming out! We just want to talk! | Morty | Rick |
| He got wrapped up in an experiment. He's a scientist. Like, legit, like on an inter-galactic, sci-fi level. His work is very -- | Rick | Beth |
| I don't know. I think like one sixty-fourth of my collars didn't work. It's hard to keep straight now that I have sixty-three other memories of everything. | Rick | Morty |
| - or sister I said any of this, I'll deny it - | Morty | Rick |
| Uh, w-why don't you get it Jerry? you're the man of the house and you don't have a job. | Morty | Rick |
| Well, I'm not calling him that. That's ridiculous. | Rick | Jerry |
| Sure. Why not? I donâ€™t, I don't know. Y-you know what, Moâ€” | Morty | Rick |
| Nobody needs anything! Okay, it's fine. I mean, you should just stay here and figure out how to stop being a pickle, okay? | Jerry | Beth |
| We're miserable, Morty! There's a mandatory curfew, their weird calendar made me 47, and they weaponized the Eiffel Tower! | Rick | Summer |
| Just focus on the mission, all right? | Rick | Morty |
| Seems like you guys need some privacy. I'll, uh -- I'll be in the garage. | Morty | Rick |
| Don't praise him now, Morty! He just peed on the carpet! Bad dog! Bad! | Rick | Jerry |
| And Iâ€˜m lucky to have you and I never tell you that! You know, we will come out of this stronger as a family! | Morty | Beth |
| Did he say he never forgets a kid? | Morty | Rick |
| Yup, it really makes you appreciate how fickle the universe can be.   One minute you're falling off a roof for six months, the next minute, bam! | Jerry | Rick |
| Then what good was the "yes"? | Morty | Beth |
| So what are you thinking, like, Smokey's Tavern? Maybe Shoney's? | Rick | Beth |
| What? What kind of monster are you? | Beth | Morty |
| Weâ€™ll take our chances raising her without fancy new jobs outside of a potato-based religion.  And you know what? Iâ€™m sick of pretending that weâ€™re together because of the kids in the first place! I married you because youâ€™re the love of my life! | Rick | Jerry |
| I'm looking at her. Thanks for F.D.'ing me up like that. | Rick | Jerry |
| Huh, what do you know, it's working | Morty | Rick |
| Got some of that mermaid puss! | Summer | Rick |
| I never said I was angry at you. | Morty | Summer |
| What? Why didn't you notify us? | Rick | Beth |
| Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on, Vance. He said you'd die if you tried to leave. That means there's booby traps. | Morty | Rick |
| What? Why are you looking at me? You want to go outside? Outside? | Rick | Jerry |
| This article says the reason we weren't involved was... "personality conflicts". | Rick | Morty |
| Man, Grandpa Rick must have gotten shitfaced. | Morty | Summer |
| Doesn't feel so good, does it? | Rick | Morty |
| I AM a baby! Iâ€™m a baby NOW! | Morty | Jerry |
| Oldest Rick trick in the book. | Morty | Rick |
| Listen, Rick, if you're gonna stay here rent-free and use my son for your stupid science, the least you could do is put a little bit of it to use for the family. You make that dog smart or Morty's grounded! | Rick | Jerry |
| Oh, for crying outâ€”he's got some kind of disability or something. Is that what you want us to say? | Rick | Jerry |
| Hey, I can't help if I can't see. | Beth | Rick |
| There is no helicopter and there is no Cervine Institute. | Morty | Jerry |
| I donâ€™t know what to say. Summer is doing really well here. | Morty | Beth |
| What?! Why would you -- Look, we're running late. We have to go. | Jerry | Beth |
| Oh, my God! He's trying to tell us something.  That is so awesome. | Morty | Summer |
| Yeah, and what's courageous about eating a hot dog? | Beth | Morty |
| Now hold on a second, letâ€™s be rational about this. | Rick | Beth |
