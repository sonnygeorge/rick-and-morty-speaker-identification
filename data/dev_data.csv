"Oh boy. Time to go, Morty.",Rick
"The Pentagon. I mean, not THE Pentagon.  The lame one, here on Earth.",Rick
"Is it God? If it’s God, do we get out of school?",Summer
"She’s allowed to think it’s God if she wants, honey!",Jerry
"Dad, what do you know about this?",Beth
Morty and I are going to look into it. You guys hold tight.,Rick
How is praying going to help?,Beth
Stay back! This watch turns people into snakes!,Rick
My name is Rick Sanchez. This here’s my grandson Morty.,Rick
"I’ve seen enough of the galaxy to know that what we’ve got here is a Cromulon from the Cygnus-5 Expanse. So you can forget about nukes, and you can forget about math.  This head won’t go away until  Earth shows them it’s got a hit song.",Rick
"No, Frasier. A live performance of a newly-written, catchy, original song. The Cromulon feed on the talent and showmanship of less-evolved lifeforms.",Rick
You’re gonna wanna put them on that giant speaker system at your sonic testing facility at Area 51.,Rick
"Rick, are you really a musician?",Morty
B-b-but we don’t have a song!,Morty
"All right, Morty, let’s get ready to do it! Why don’t you, uh, find a button on one of those keyboards and lay down some kind of beat?",Rick
"Rick, I think we need to cut our losses. We get our family and portal out of here!",Morty
"Morty! Good music comes from people who are relaxed. Just hit a button, Morty! Gimme a beat!",Rick
"Oh man, ok, all right, um…",Morty
Ahhhhh yeahhhhh Ya gotta get schwifty  Ya gotta get schwifty in here It’s time to get schwifty,Rick
Take off your pants and your panties Shit on the floor Time to get schwifty in here I’m Mr. Bulldops,Rick
Take a shit on the floor Time to get schwifty in here,Rick
"Hey, take your pants off It’s schwifty time today",Rick
"Now hold on a second, let’s be rational about this.",Beth
"No, I’m… I’m just saying, we don’t know if there’s a cause-effect relationship --",Beth
"Oh, God, what’s going on now?",Beth
I think planet Earth has just been transported.,Rick
"Oh dear giant head, we apologize for that discussion! It will never happen again!",Summer
"Uhh, it’s probably a bad time to mention it, but any astronauts you guys had in orbit are definitely dead.",Rick
Like we’re not already under enough pressure!,Morty
"Geez, Morty. The guy’s just doing his job. Take it easy.",Rick
"Rick, Ice-T, could you guys take it less easy?! We’ve got six hours to come up with a song!",Morty
"Genius happens in the moment, Morty.",Rick
"Well, can we at least go get our family? You know, so we can take them with-with-with us if we lose?",Morty
"That’s planning for failure, Morty. Even dumber than regular planning.  Balls.",Rick
"Morty, Morty, stop! Listen! There’s only so much charge left in this thing. If we portal home from here and back, we’re not gonna have enough charge left to get off-world. Get it?",Rick
"Yeah,  you see, I try to shelter you from certain realities,  Morty. Cause if I let you make me nervous, then we can’t get schwifty.",Rick
Stop saying it like it’s a thing! You made it up!,Morty
"Hey, Morty! Could you lick my…",Rick
"Rick, cut it out! That’s not funny, Rick!",Morty
We should pack up and leave town now.,Beth
"I think it’s inspiring that our community is coping with fear in a way that involves a festival and homemade ice cream. If you’d stop being such an evangelical atheist, you might start enjoying yourself.",Jerry
Whoa! Look at you! You’re wearing the hat and everything!,Jerry
"Here’s yours!  Mom, do you mind if I cook dinner tonight?",Summer
I love you guys. You gave me life. And it’s the will of the many heads that all children honor their parents.,Summer
"Father, can we please go to the Ascension?",Summer
Sure! Let’s go to the Ascension. Wh-wh-what is it?,Jerry
"Oh yes, yes! Rise to the giant head! You are free to be free!",Summer
"Wait, wait, wait! Come on, h-hold on a second!",Rick
"Whoa, whoa! Morty! Give me that!",Rick
You lied! You lied about the charge! You were just being lazy! Get back! Sit down!,Morty
"Morty, just put it down. You don’t know what you’re doing.",Rick
I’m going to go find Mom and Dad.,Morty
And then Ethan played guitar and we learned the Seven Contemplations of the Head by singing them. It was really fun. Praise be the head!,Summer
I don’t know what to say. Summer is doing really well here.,Beth
"She’s aced every test in potato class, and look how important potatoes have become.",Jerry
She’s not getting pregnant or doing drugs or missing curfew…,Beth
That’s not our business as long as Summer is thriving!,Beth
Taco time!  I hope it pleases you as the head desires.,Summer
"We’re so proud of you. But honestly, you don’t have to make dinner every night.",Jerry
"Of course I do, silly!  Oh my God, daddy, I’m sorry I called you silly! I’m so sorry!  Heavenly head and cranial creator! Forgive my transgressions against family and community! May my chores complete me as I complete them!",Summer
"Wh-What do you think, Ice? Probably a little over-developed.",Rick
"Well, do you think maybe, could you give me some help with it, or… ?",Rick
"Ice, I don’t want to be a negative Nelly or anything, but  if Morty doesn’t come back with my portal gun and I eat it out there, it’s, uh, kind of your problem too.",Rick
What the fuck? You can turn into ice?,Rick
"Take it from me, Ice.  You can’t just  float around space not caring about stuff forever.",Rick
"But can you help me get to my family? You know, at my house?",Morty
"All of Rick’s moves are dick moves! Wh-what am I eating? What is this, bird seed?",Morty
"Tammy… gross. Birdperson, you always stick up for Rick, but he doesn’t care about anyone but himself. He doesn’t think about the consequences of anything he does.",Morty
That’s my dream! That’s my dream.,Beth
"Thank you. This is all so overwhelming, but, uh… we can’t.",Jerry
"We’ve been waiting 16 years for our daughter to respect us, but the key is, it has to be “our” daughter, not this person she’s become.",Beth
We’ll take our chances raising her without fancy new jobs outside of a potato-based religion.  And you know what? I’m sick of pretending that we’re together because of the kids in the first place! I married you because you’re the love of my life!,Jerry
"And I‘m lucky to have you and I never tell you that! You know, we will come out of this stronger as a family!",Beth
"Please don’t do this, please don’t do this! Summer!",Beth
"Summer, listen carefully. I stole a paper clip and I have it in my cheek but I don’t know what to do with it and it hurts.",Jerry
You’re going to be ok!  You will come back as babies!,Summer
I AM a baby! I’m a baby NOW!,Jerry
Hello? Is anybody here?  Mr. President!,Morty
"Sir, I need to get to the stage and help Rick get schwifty!",Morty
Oh my God! C-c-can you fly a Blackhawk?,Morty
"Mr. President, if I’ve learned one thing today, it’s that sometimes, you have to not give a fuck!",Morty
I say…  Let’s do it!,Rick
"Yeah, it’s possible that we may have been correlating some things that weren’t actually related at all.",Jerry
Sure thing! And I was kinda hoping that I could get a selfie with you?,Morty
"Trade secret, Mr. President. Particle beam in a wristwatch… snake holster on the leg.",Rick
"Alright, Morty. You ready for our adventure to the lost city of Atlantis?",Rick
"Ready as I’ll ever be, Rick!",Morty
"What are you, stupid? We’re done with the Citadel of Ricks. I was  never on board with it in the first place, that’s why I murdered everyone in charge and left it to rot.",Rick
They tried to murder him first.,Morty
"Yeah, he knows. He murdered them.",Morty
You don’t have to be a dick.,Rick
Geez. I didn’t know there were still Ricks and Mortys living on the Citadel. I wonder what their day-to-day lives are like.,Morty
"Well, you can keep wondering that while we go on our fun, fresh, self-contained adventure to Atlantis.  Anyone continuing to explore the Citadel is either stupid, or one of the unfortunate millions held hostage by their terrible ideas.",Rick
Man. Glad I’m not one of them!,Morty
Got some of that mermaid puss!,Rick
"I'm really hoping it wasn't a one-off thing and I can see her again. By the way, hey, um... still not curious about what might've happened at that crazy Citadel place?",Morty
"Pssh! Not at all, Morty. That place will never have any bearing over our lives ever again. Unlike that mermaid puss! Yeah!! We're going back for seconds! We're gonna do that shit every week, man! That was Atlantis!",Rick
