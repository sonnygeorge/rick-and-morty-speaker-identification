"Okay, hold on just a second, Morty.",Rick,Morty
"Uh, yeah, just a few more design notes.  Um, this guy. The, uh... The, uh...",Rick,Supernova
"Uh, what? It was your job, Morty.",Summer,Morty
"Oh, God, what’s going on now?",Beth,Beth
"He bails on everybody! He bailed on Mom when she was a kid! He -- He bailed on tiny planet! And in case I never made this clear to you, Summer, he bailed on you. He left you to rot in a world that he ruined because he doesn't care! Because nobody's special to him, Summer, not even himself. So, if you really want your grandpa back, grab a shovel. The one that won't let you down is buried in your backyard!",Morty,Summer
I told the both of you school is stupid. It's not how you learn things. Morty's a gifted child. He has a special mind. That's why he's my little helper. He's like me. He's gonna be doing great science stuff later in his life. He's too smart for school. He needs to keep hanging out and helping me.,Rick,Jerry
"Wow! A whole world populated by intelligent dogs. I wonder what it'll be like, Rick.",Morty,Beth
"That's my one-armed man! I'm not driven by avenging my dead family, Morty! That was fake. I-I-I'm driven by finding that McNugget sauce.",Rick,Morty
Don't worry about Jerry. He's gonna be fine.You hear me Jerry? You're gonna be fine!,Rick,
Morty let's-let's see what else is on.,Rick,Morty
I'll cover that bet. I get it.,Morty,Supernova
Whoa! Look! It's that lady with all that shit on her face like Worf from Star Trek! That was getting coffee! How did she get there!,Morty,Morty
"Pretty concise, Morty. Looks like we've merely prolonged the inevitable. That's it, Morty! Prolonging the inevitable! Listen, if we go into Mrs. Pancakes' dream, everything will go 100 times slower, Morty. That'll buy us some time to figure this out!",Rick,Morty
"That's right, Morty. This is gonna be a lot like that, except, you know, it's gonna may--be make sense.",Rick,Morty
"Boy, you really got me up against a wall this time, Jerry.",Rick,Morty
"Aw, geez. Okay. I guess I can skip history. What about Frank? I mean, shouldn't you unfreeze him?",Morty,Rick
"Because you suck! You've been keeping your lip zipped about it since Grandpa got arrested, but the fact is, you're freaking stoked to bail on him.",Summer,Morty
"Full disclosure, Morty it's not. Temporary superintelligence is just a side effect of the mega seeds dissolving in your rectal cavity.",Rick,Morty
"It's about to get a whole lot weirder, Morty.",Rick,Morty
"No, you can't!  Jessica doesn't even know I exist! But—but, but forget about that, because you can't blow up humanity!",Morty,Rick
"Hey! I said nobody move, buddy!",Rick,Rick
Me. I used to wear blue pants.,Rick,Cornvelious Daniel
"But can you help me get to my family? You know, at my house?",Morty,Birdperson
"I would have been happy to pay for it, Summer, but they don't exactly sell them at Costco. Besides, there's a larger lesson to be learned here. Get him!",Rick,Summer
"Alright! That's enough. You're talking about my species! We understand genocide, we do it sometimes!",Jerry,Jerry
"Come on, Morty! We got to get the hell out of here!",Rick,Morty
"I am not putting my father in a home! He just came back into my life, and you want to grab him and stuff him under a mattress like last month's Victoria's Secret?",Beth,Rick
"Morty, Mom's talking. I'm sorry, I suppose that's a good segue into our little discipline cases here.",Beth,Morty
"Yeah, we missed you so much. Too much to hug you though.",Summer,Morty
"Yes I will! That's right, assholes, take my penis, TAKE IT ALL! And tell Shrimply Pimples that when the galaxy came calling Jerry Smith from Earth didn't flinch!",Jerry,Jerry
You don’t have to be a dick.,Rick,Rick
"I don't know, Rick. I can't leave school again.",Morty,Rick
"Man that guy is the Red Grin Grumble to pretending he knows what's going on.  Oh you agree, huh?  You like that Red Grin Grumble reference?  Well guess what? I made him up. You really are your father's children. Think for yourselves, don't be sheep.",Rick,Morty
"Good job, Morty. Let's go, kids.",Rick,Riq IV
"You're growing up fast, Morty. You're growing into a real big thorn straight up into my ass!  Listen, this is called oxytocin. I extracted it from a vole. You know what a VOLE is, Morty, you know what a vole is?",Rick,Morty
I am sad that I peed. I'm sad that I peed in class instead of a toilet.,Morty,Dr. Wong
"You know what I'm talking about, oh yeah. I'm gonna do the cabbage patch, Morty. Check me out I'm doing the cabbage patch dance. It's a classic dance, remember, like this. Oh shit look at that.",Rick,Morty
Hello? Is anybody here?  Mr. President!,Morty,Jerry
"They're just robots, Morty! It's okay to shoot them! They're robots!",Rick,Morty
"I'm sorry. It's just like the end of ""Old Yeller.",Jerry,Beth
"I-I get what you're trying to say, Morty. Listen, I'm not...  You don't got... Y-you don’t gotta worry about me trying to fool around with Jessica or mess around with Jessica or anything. I'm not that kind of guy, Morty.",Rick,Morty
"Morty, oh, you really d-did a number on  your legs right now. You know, you got to turn  the shoes on, Morty, for them to work. Yeah, look I turned mine on. I had no problem getting down here. It was a leisurely breeze.",Rick,Principal Vagina
"Is there coffee? Hey, Morty, can you be a pal? Grandpa left his coffee maker on the ship. Y-You know, the French press thing?",Rick,Alan
It's the Citadel of Ricks. All the different Ricks from all the different realities got together to hide here from the government.,Morty,Summer
How is praying going to help?,Beth,Mr. Goldenfold
"You don't need to say anything. We got you, dawg.",Morty,Scary Terry
"Aw! Oh, my God! He recognizes the other dogs on TV.",Summer,Summer
The day I invented the portal gun is the day I lost her.,Rick,Cornvelious Daniel
"- Because that's -- that's what this is all about, Morty.",Rick,Morty
"It's Dimension 35-C, and it's got the perfect climate conditions for a special type of tree, Morty, called a Mega Tree, and there's fruit in those trees, and there's seeds in those fruits. I'm talking about Mega Seeds. They're they're incredibly powerful, and I need them to help me with my research, Morty.",Rick,Morty
I don't know yet. I'll make it up as I go. That's what Grandpa Rick does. That's what heroes do.,Summer,Morty
"Okay, with all due respect, Rick— what am I talking about? What respect is due? How is my son supposed to pass his classes if you keep dragging him off for high-concept Sci-Fi rigamarole?",Jerry,Rick
"Hey, what's wrong Morty? Oh, you're worried about your dad, huh?",Rick,Jerry
"There's just one problem, Morty one little hang-up. The dimension I visited was so advanced, that  they had also halted the aging process, and everyone there was young, Morty, and they had been forever. I was the only old person there, Morty.  It was like I was some sort of, you know, celebrity, walking around. I-I was fascinating to them. There were a lot of attractive women there, Morty, and they-they-they— they all wanted time with me. I had a lot of fun with a lot of young ladies, but I spent so much time there, my interdimensional portal device it's got no charge left, Morty. It's got no charge left.",Rick,Morty
"Morty, come on. I need your help tonight.",Rick,Jerry
"Morty, stay out of this. You are obviously not capable of judging these situations on your own.",Jerry,Morty
"Out of the frying pan dot, dot, dot, huh, Morty?",Rick,Morty
"If it takes nine seasons, I want my McNugget dipping sauce, Szechuan sauce, Morty.",Rick,Morty
I mean it's been shot. With a gun.,Beth,Jerry
No idea what you're talking about.,Rick,Summer
Sure thing! And I was kinda hoping that I could get a selfie with you?,Morty,President
"Really? You don't say. You would have used a ghost train?  Hey, everybody, the ghost train guy would have used a ghost train!",Rick,Alan
"You can get his number later. Come on, Morty. We got to get out of here. You got to get those seeds out of your ass.",Rick,Morty
"Boom! Told you! In your face! He is ruining our child! Wait, what am I celebrating?",Jerry,Principal Vagina
"Jerry, this was the most romantic weekend I've ever had.",Beth,Beth
"Summer, listen carefully. I stole a paper clip and I have it in my cheek but I don’t know what to do with it and it hurts.",Jerry,Beth
"Just take these shoes, Morty. They're  special grappling shoes. When you're wearing these things, these babies, you can basically just walk on any surface you want, Morty up, down, below, turn around to the left. These things really bring it all together.",Rick,Rick
Grandpa Rick wouldn't put up with this!,Summer,Jerry
"That’s planning for failure, Morty. Even dumber than regular planning.  Balls.",Rick,Morty
"Oh, man, Rick. What is this place?",Morty,Morty
"Goldenfold, we're coming out! We just want to talk!",Rick,Snuffles
"Uh, the adventure is the favor, Morty. Me sleeping on these linens is the favor. I mean, w-w-w-what--what are we vindicating? Comfort?",Rick,Morty
"He got wrapped up in an experiment. He's a scientist. Like, legit, like on an inter-galactic, sci-fi level. His work is very --",Beth,Dr. Wong
I don't know. I think like one sixty-fourth of my collars didn't work. It's hard to keep straight now that I have sixty-three other memories of everything.,Morty,Summer
"Yeah, Rick... I-it's great. Is this the surprise?",Morty,Rick
"- or sister I said any of this, I'll deny it -",Rick,Morty
"Don't worry about it, Morty. Just come help me get these seeds, all right, buddy?",Rick,Morty
"Uh, w-why don't you get it Jerry? you're the man of the house and you don't have a job.",Rick,Beth
"Man, he sure says ""bitch"" a lot!",Morty,Morty
"Well, I'm not calling him that. That's ridiculous.",Jerry,Summer
"Are you kidding me? This again? Oh, man, it looks like we've hit dream bedrock here, Morty.",Rick,Morty
"I didn't say my father is perfect, I said his work is important.",Beth,Pickle Rick
"Sure. Why not? I don’t, I don't know. Y-you know what, Mo—",Rick,Morty
"Nobody needs anything! Okay, it's fine. I mean, you should just stay here and figure out how to stop being a pickle, okay?",Beth,Pickle Rick
"We're miserable, Morty! There's a mandatory curfew, their weird calendar made me 47, and they weaponized the Eiffel Tower!",Summer,Morty
I don't care about Jessica! Y-Yyyyyyyyyyou—,Morty,Rick
"When we get to customs, I'm gonna need you to take these seeds into the bathroom, and I'm gonna need you to put them way up inside your butthole, Morty.",Rick,Morty
"All right, all right, calm down. Listen to me, Morty. I know that new situations can be intimidating. You're looking around, and it's all scary and different, but, you know, m-meeting them head on, charging right into them like a bull that's how we grow as people. I'm no stranger to scary situations. I deal with them all the time. Now, if you just stick with me, Morty, we're gonna be—",Rick,Morty
"Just focus on the mission, all right?",Morty,Rick
"Seems like you guys need some privacy. I'll, uh -- I'll be in the garage.",Rick,Jerry
"Don't praise him now, Morty! He just peed on the carpet! Bad dog! Bad!",Jerry,Morty
And then Ethan played guitar and we learned the Seven Contemplations of the Head by singing them. It was really fun. Praise be the head!,Summer,Morty
"And I‘m lucky to have you and I never tell you that! You know, we will come out of this stronger as a family!",Beth,Jerry
Did he say he never forgets a kid?,Rick,Morty
"Rick, this really bums me out. It-It's embarrassing to find out these guys don't like us.",Morty,Rick
"Yup, it really makes you appreciate how fickle the universe can be.   One minute you're falling off a roof for six months, the next minute, bam!",Rick,Summer
"Oh man, I'm trying to remember Morty.",Rick,Morty
"Then what good was the ""yes""?",Beth,Jerry
"So what are you thinking, like, Smokey's Tavern? Maybe Shoney's?",Beth,Morty
Whatever. How petty would I have to be to care less about an animal's life than my own ego?,Beth,Jerry
"That's enough! Drop the gun, Rick!",Morty,Rick
"Okay, I only ask, Jerry, because, as you know, my job involves performing heart surgery.",Beth,Jerry
What? What kind of monster are you?,Morty,Summer
We’ll take our chances raising her without fancy new jobs outside of a potato-based religion.  And you know what? I’m sick of pretending that we’re together because of the kids in the first place! I married you because you’re the love of my life!,Jerry,Beth
I'm looking at her. Thanks for F.D.'ing me up like that.,Jerry,Beth
"Huh, what do you know, it's working",Rick,All Ricks
"No, Frasier. A live performance of a newly-written, catchy, original song. The Cromulon feed on the talent and showmanship of less-evolved lifeforms.",Rick,Rick
"Come on, Morty. Please, Morty. You have to do it, Morty.",Rick,Morty
Got some of that mermaid puss!,Rick,Morty
I never said I was angry at you.,Summer,Beth
What? Why didn't you notify us?,Beth,Principal Vagina
"This better not be a bribe. If I find a single thing out of place in this house, my love of ice cream won't save you. I'll get my jacket.",Jerry,Rick
"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on, Vance. He said you'd die if you tried to leave. That means there's booby traps.",Rick,Vance
"Yikes. Yeah, things did feel less diverse in there.",Rick,Morty
What? Why are you looking at me? You want to go outside? Outside?,Jerry,
Ow! Ow! You're tugging me too hard!,Morty,Rick
"There she is. All right. Come on, Morty. Let's go.",Rick,Beth
"I don't either. I-I'm just saying, if anything, the drunk version of me is probably so supportive of Israel, he wants what's best for it and...",Rick,Million Ants
"This article says the reason we weren't involved was... ""personality conflicts"".",Morty,Rick
"Actually, sorry Summer, I gotta back the M bomb on this one. I remember the conversation. We told Morty to replace all the bank's money with cookies, your job was to put the mattress under Mr. Benson.",Rick,Summer
"Man, Grandpa Rick must have gotten shitfaced.",Summer,Morty
"And they'll fall right out of mine. I've done this too many times, Morty. I mean, you're young. Y-y-you've got your whole life ahead of you, and your anal cavity is still taut, yet malleable. You got to do it for grandpa, Morty. Y-  you've got to put these seeds inside your butt.",Rick,Morty
"Rick? Are you far away, or are you inside something?",Morty,Pickle Rick
"Sir, I need to get to the stage and help Rick get schwifty!",Morty,President
"Little extra  snippy this morning, aren't you?",Rick,Morty
"Uh, I kind of am. I saved the goddamn universe.",Rick,Morty
"Time to go another dream deep, Morty!",Rick,Summer
"Doesn't feel so good, does it?",Morty,Beth
"Because it's incentive for you to give me my cleanest shot, which will be your least painful death. But if you want to die slower than that, I'm super into it. All you got to do to get that started is kill the girl.",Rick,Riq IV
Who cares about the  thing you guys are talking about? The whole point of freezing time is to stop giving a fuck. Put a shirt on your dumb dad and let's get this dumb universe rolling. Let's do this thing.,Rick,Summer
"You have to turn them on, Morty! The shoes have to be turned on!",Rick,Morty
"Go in the waiting room, Dad.",Beth,Rick
I AM a baby! I’m a baby NOW!,Jerry,Summer
Oldest Rick trick in the book.,Rick,Summer
"Listen, Rick, if you're gonna stay here rent-free and use my son for your stupid science, the least you could do is put a little bit of it to use for the family. You make that dog smart or Morty's grounded!",Jerry,Rick
"Oh, for crying out—he's got some kind of disability or something. Is that what you want us to say?",Jerry,Rick
Alright. I'll-I'll land. I'll land. I'll land. I'll land the thing. I’ll land the thing. Big tough guy all of a sudden.,Rick,Rick
"Alan, I'm not proud of what's happening here, but if you keep coming at me, there's gonna be another passenger on that ghost train.",Rick,Alan
Because Ricks hate themselves the most. And our Rick is the most himself.,Morty,Summer
"Are you guys Power Rangers? But only on one small part of your necks? Hey, do those things need batteries? Were they included? Clean up in the fruit isle! Not in a homophobic way though, they're just fruity necklaces is all I was saying.",Jerry,Jerry
"Hey, I can't help if I can't see.",Rick,Supernova
There is no helicopter and there is no Cervine Institute.,Jerry,Beth
I don’t know what to say. Summer is doing really well here.,Beth,Summer
"Aw, geez, dad. Y-you know, that's a lot to drop on a kid all at once.",Morty,Jerry
"What?! Why would you -- Look, we're running late. We have to go.",Beth,Pickle Rick
But.. she was trying to kill us!,Morty,Rick
Not until I finish what I started. And that is how you get level-nine access without a password.,Rick,Summer
"Right, Crocubot. So, you're half-cold, unfeeling reptile, half-also cold, equally-unfeeling machine.",Rick,Rick
"Yeah, and once those seeds wear off, you're gonna lose most of your motor skills, and you're also gonna lose a significant amount of brain functionality for 72 hours, Morty.",Rick,Morty
"What? N-No, I don't want to see your Pog collection. I don't renounce Rick, and I never have. I was just trying to protect my sister. I wanted you to have a normal life. That's something you can't have when Rick shows up. Everything real turns fake. Everything right is wrong. All you know is that you know nothing and he knows everything. And, well -- well, he's not a villain, Summer, but he shouldn't be your hero. He's more like a demon or a super fucked up god.",Morty,Riq IV
"But I obviously sort of love you, don't I?  So stop asking and maybe I'll love you more.  Crap, They need me at the horse hospital.",Beth,Jerry
"Oh, my God! He's trying to tell us something.  That is so awesome.",Summer,Snuffles
What are you trying to say about Morty? That he's stupid or something?,Rick,Jerry
"Yeah, and what's courageous about eating a hot dog?",Morty,Summer
"Now hold on a second, let’s be rational about this.",Beth,Principal Vagina
