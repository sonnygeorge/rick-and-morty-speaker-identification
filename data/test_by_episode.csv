"Ohhh. Okay, here we go.    H-Heyy Jessica, ughh.",Morty,Principal Vagina
"Well, I mean, I was thinking about it.",Morty,Brad
"Eh, Try not to worry about it, Morty. You're a good kid, and there's not a premium on that right now, but you'll be getting girls sometime after Brad's out of shape.",Jerry,Brad
"You're missing the point, Dad. I don't want girls, I want Jessica!",Morty,Jerry
"Ahhh, well,  I remember feeling that way about a young lady named your mom, and that's not an urban dis, your mom was my Jessica. I remember the first time I saw her, I thought...",Jerry,Morty
"I should get her pregnant, then she'll have to marry me.",Rick,Jerry
"I beg your pardon, Rick, INAPPROPRIATE.",Jerry,Rick
"Sorry, please proceed with your story about banging my daughter in high school.  I'm not sure you want to take romantic advice from this guy, Morty, his marriage is hanging from a thread.",Rick,Jerry
"My marriage is fine, thank you.",Jerry,Rick
"Jerry, it's your house, whatever you say it is is how it is,  but I think a blind man could see that Beth is looking for the door. I barely have a reason to care and even I noticed.",Rick,Jerry
"Come on, Rick, don't talk about my parents like that.",Morty,Rick
"Listen, Morty, I hate to break it to you, but what people call ""love"" is a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed. It hits hard, Morty, then it slowly fades, leaving you stranded in a failing marriage. I did it, your parents are gonna do it. Break the cycle, Morty. Rise above. Focus on science.",Rick,Morty
"Alright, well, I'm gonna go get dressed for the dance.",Morty,Rick
"Yeah, I'm just going to...check on your mom.",Jerry,Morty
"Morty, hand me that screwdriver, huh?  I'm almost finished making my ionic defibulizer, Morty. It's gonna be great.",Rick,Jerry
"Hey, listen, Rick. You know how you said that, you know... love is a chemical and all that stuff from earlier?  Well, I was thinkn', you know, www... could you make some sort of chemical thing happen inside of Jessica's mind, you know, so where she falls in love with me and all that sort of thing, you know, like maybe make some sort of love potion or something?",Morty,Rick
"Morty, that's such a poor use of my time, it's beneath me. Hand me the screwdriver.",Rick,Morty
"YOU KNOW WHAT, NO RICK! I'M NOT GONNA HAND YOU THE SCREWDRIVER! Uh, I'm never gonna hand you anything ever again, Rick.  I'm always helping you with this and that and the other thing. Www...what about me, Rick? Www... why can't you just help me out once, once, for once?",Morty,Rick
"You're growing up fast, Morty. You're growing into a real big thorn straight up into my ass!  Listen, this is called oxytocin. I extracted it from a vole. You know what a VOLE is, Morty, you know what a vole is?",Rick,Morty
"It's a, it's a rodent that mates for life, Morty. This is the chemical release in the mammal's brain,  ...that makes it fall in love. Alright Morty, I just gotta  combine it with some of your DNA.",Rick,Rick
"A hair, Morty, I need one of your hairs! This isn't Game Of Thrones.",Rick,Morty
"Alright, Morty, whoever you smear this stuff on will fall in love with you, and only you, forever. Ya happy now, Morty?",Rick,Morty
"Heck yeah! Thank you, Grandpa Rick!  Hey there's no dangers or anything or side effects, right?",Morty,Rick
"Www.. what am I, a hack?! Go nuts, Morty, it's full proof.",Rick,Morty
"Ugh, unless she has the flu.",Rick,Rick
"Beth, do you still love me?",Jerry,Rick
"Jerry, do you want homeless people to have homes?",Beth,Jerry
"Then what good was the ""yes""?",Beth,Jerry
"Wait, iii... is loving me the house or the homeless people?",Jerry,Beth
"Loving you is work, Jerry, hard work, like building a homeless shelter. Nobody want to say ""no"" to doing it, but some people put the work in. So what do ya say? Do you see me working here? Does this conversation seem tedious to me?",Beth,Jerry
"But I obviously sort of love you, don't I?  So stop asking and maybe I'll love you more.  Crap, They need me at the horse hospital.",Beth,Jerry
"The racetrack had a starlit derby, there's a seven horse collision, and Davin's there alone.",Beth,Jerry
"Oh man. I love you too, Jessica!",Morty,Jessica
"Uh, sure. I mean, of course not. What do you think that was all about?",Morty,Jessica
She's gonna be alone with that guy all night.,Jerry,Brad
"Yeah, Dad, digging around the inside of horses. It's not a very romantic setting.",Summer,Jerry
Don't worry about Jerry. He's gonna be fine.You hear me Jerry? You're gonna be fine!,Rick,
"ooo... Watch out for that stuff. It'll stain if it gets on your clothes, and it'll send into a murderous rage if it gets in your eyes or mouth.",Rick,Morty
Why would you keep mutant bacteria in a pint of Cherry Garcia?,Beth,Rick
"I know this isn't the time, but, you know, technically the second freezer drawer is mine.",Rick,Beth
"Alright fine, but you're not touching my CRISPR.",Rick,Rick
What? Every hospital claims to have the best doctor in the galaxy. It's like those pizza places that claim to have the best pizza in the world. What- Do you think they have pizza contests? Have you ever been to a pizza contest?,Rick,Summer
"Go in the waiting room, Dad.",Beth,Rick
"Fine!  Excuse me. Coming through. What are you here for- Just kidding, I don't care. Well this won't do.",Rick,Beth
"Yeah me neither, we pretty much nailed it the first time.",Rick,Rick
"You gotta be careful Morty, if that guy catches you with a box of his eye-holes he comes bursting in through a window and just starts kicking the shit outta you. But it's worth the risk, they melt in your mouth Morty! They're delicious.",Rick,Announcer
"I can't believe you're explaining alien cereal, we're worried about Jerry.",Beth,Rick
"Well you're thirty-nine years too late, or however old he is. Is he fifty? Oh man, Beth is, is Jerry fifity!?",Rick,Beth
"Alright! That's enough. You're talking about my species! We understand genocide, we do it sometimes!",Jerry,Jerry
"Yes I will! That's right, assholes, take my penis, TAKE IT ALL! And tell Shrimply Pimples that when the galaxy came calling Jerry Smith from Earth didn't flinch!",Jerry,Jerry
"Hey, what's wrong Morty? Oh, you're worried about your dad, huh?",Rick,Jerry
"Huh? Uh, no no no, I'm-I'm just looking at that lady getting coffee. What's up with her face? Is she a human or is she like Worf. You know Worf, from Star Trek, where he has the shit all over his face but he's just a human in a costume, you know?",Morty,Rick
Morty let's-let's see what else is on.,Rick,Morty
Whoa! Look! It's that lady with all that shit on her face like Worf from Star Trek! That was getting coffee! How did she get there!,Morty,Morty
"Oh, man Morty. How DID she get there?",Rick,Morty
Is that something we should be concerned about?,Beth,Rick
Just stay away from the coffee machine.,Rick,Beth
"Oh man, I'm trying to remember Morty.",Rick,Morty
Is it important that we know who Jan-Michael Vincent is in order to get this?,Morty,Announcer
"Excuse me, nurse, can you take my temperature? Because I think I have Jan Quadrant Vincent fever over here.",Morty,Rick
"All right, Morty you've done it!",Rick,Morty
"Oh, you know what, I gotta laugh at myself here! I'm having a little laugh at myself because I just realized I haven't run this whole decision past my wife.",Jerry,Alien Doctor
"Oh, absolutely. Beth is automatically on board, always, with every decision I make.",Jerry,Alien Doctor
"Hi, honey, so, here's the thing-these guys-they want to completely remove my penis and use it as an alien's heart, and we just need you to sign off on it.",Jerry,Alien Doctor
"Uh-oh, maybe we have a problem here after all guys. Yikes.",Jerry,Beth
"I don't care about prosthetics, this is insane! What do you people think you're doing?",Beth,Alien Doctor
"Oh, I don't think you do. I bring my husband in for emergency medical treatment, he's gone an hour, and now you want his PENIS, and you hand me some... catalog. It's--It's--It's--It's, I mean.",Beth,Alien Doctor
"Sheesh, well, there you go. Sorry. I know it's hard to understand but on Earth, love comes first.",Jerry,Beth
"Woah! Woah. So, billions of life forms?",Beth,Alien Doctor
"I mean, Jerry, y-you didn't explain the full gravity of the situation.",Beth,Alien Doctor
"Uh, well, Beth, I don't think your decision should be based on politics. Who could argue with a wife's decision to keep her LOVER INTACT.",Jerry,Beth
"Well I don't think that's fair at all, Jerry. At all. In fact, I think this whole paradigm has sexist overtones.",Beth,Jerry
"Beth, can we talk about this privately?",Jerry,Beth
"You know, I think, the bottom line is, Jerry, if you want to keep your penis, you should say, out loud, ""I prefer to keep my penis.""",Beth,Jerry
"But, Beth, what kind of man would say something like that if the universe needed his penis!?!",Jerry,Beth
"Well, Jerry, what kind of wife would I be if I did anything to stand in your way?",Beth,Jerry
"Rick? Are you far away, or are you inside something?",Morty,Pickle Rick
"Are you invisible and you're gonna, like, fart on me?",Morty,Pickle Rick
"What, I'm gonna touch it, and you're gonna tell me it's an alien dick or something.",Morty,Pickle Rick
"Are you going to, I mean, you know, is this the first part of some magic trick?",Morty,Pickle Rick
"Well, can you move? Can you fly?",Morty,Pickle Rick
"All right, well, do pickles live forever or --",Morty,Pickle Rick
I-I'm just trying to figure out why you would do this. Why anyone would do this.,Morty,Pickle Rick
"Morty, we have to get going, or we're gonna be late. Where's your grandpa?",Beth,Pickle Rick
"What?! Why would you -- Look, we're running late. We have to go.",Beth,Pickle Rick
"We have an appointment downtown that was set a week ago and agreed upon by everyone, including you.",Beth,Pickle Rick
"Rick, did you do this on purpose to get out of family counseling?",Morty,Pickle Rick
Can't you just turn yourself back into a human?,Summer,Pickle Rick
"Nobody needs anything! Okay, it's fine. I mean, you should just stay here and figure out how to stop being a pickle, okay?",Beth,Pickle Rick
"Hey, Rick, why is there a syringe of mysterious fluid hanging directly over you? Also, why is the string attached to it running through a pair of scissors attached to a timer? And why is the time set to 10 minutes from now, exactly when we would have left for therapy?",Morty,Beth
"Enough. Kids, it's time to go. We don't want to be late.",Beth,Pickle Rick
"Well, I mean, you don't want to get pierced by a needle full of liquid unrelated to your situation. How's that gonna help?",Beth,Pickle Rick
How is this even family therapy if Dad's not invited and Grandpa won't come?,Summer,Pickle Rick
"Yeah, and what's courageous about eating a hot dog?",Morty,Summer
"It's nobody's choice to be here, you knobs. The family was told to get counseling by your principal, even though it's not the family that was huffing pottery glaze in the art room and desk wetting in history class.",Beth,Morty
Temporarily. By order of the school.,Beth,Mr. Goldenfold
"He got wrapped up in an experiment. He's a scientist. Like, legit, like on an inter-galactic, sci-fi level. His work is very --",Beth,Dr. Wong
He turned himself into a pickle.,Morty,Beth
"Morty, Mom's talking. I'm sorry, I suppose that's a good segue into our little discipline cases here.",Beth,Morty
"What? No, what kind of question is that?",Beth,Dr. Wong
"Oh, Jesus Christ, one of these. No, my father has never turned himself into a pickle before. He's unpredictable and eccentric. The whole family is. Speaking of which...",Beth,Dr. Wong
"I didn't say my father is perfect, I said his work is important.",Beth,Pickle Rick
And she's saying what's important is that Grandpa lied to you to get out of coming here.,Summer,Beth
Do you really not see what's happening here?,Beth,Dr. Wong
"Well, Dr. Wong -- by the way, racist name -- obviously, Morty and Summer are seizing on your arbitrary pickle obsession as an end run around what was supposed to be their therapy.",Beth,Dr. Wong
You're the one that costs $200 an hour. You tell me.,Beth,Dr. Wong
My kids pee their desks and suck on unbaked vases.,Beth,Dr. Wong
I never said I was angry at you.,Summer,Beth
"That's the point of pottery-enamel huffing, Summer. You do it so you don't have to say ""I'm angry at mommy"" out loud.",Beth,Summer
"He won't have to ask for it, okay? He won't need it. He'll just make more. He doesn't need anything from anyone.",Beth,Dr. Wong
It's better than making your problems other people's problems.,Beth,Dr. Wong
I am afraid that my kids will get expelled.,Beth,Pickle Rick
I am mad that I can't huff enamel without people assuming it's because my family sucks. I hope to be seen one day as someone that just likes getting high.,Summer,Dr. Wong
I am sad that I peed. I'm sad that I peed in class instead of a toilet.,Morty,Dr. Wong
Dad I would like you to tell me what's in the syringe.,Beth,Pickle Rick
"Oh, it's fine. I mean, thank you, and, yeah, you shouldn't. But I hope you know that's not what that session was supposed to be.",Beth,Pickle Rick
"She huffed enamel, and we never even talked about it.",Beth,Pickle Rick
"Oh, my God, yes! Dad, it's in my purse. Oh, I'm sorry. You must be in agony.",Beth,Pickle Rick
"Man, I missed having hands and blood and a stomach.",Rick,Beth
"Really? Like, go somewhere? Yeah, let's drop the kids off and go tie one on.",Beth,Rick
"So what are you thinking, like, Smokey's Tavern? Maybe Shoney's?",Beth,Morty
"You'll never get away with this, Concerto.",Rick,Rick
"This is it, Morty. We're goners. We're not getting out of this one. After everything we've been through, this is how we're gonna die. Make peace with your god.",Rick,Rick
"Oh, geez, Rick, I-I-I don't want to die!",Morty,Rick
"That, Morty, is why you don't go to therapy.",Rick,Morty
