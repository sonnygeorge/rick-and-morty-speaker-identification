"Ohhh. Okay, here we go.    H-Heyy Jessica, ughh.",Morty
"Well, I mean, I was thinking about it.",Morty
"Eh, Try not to worry about it, Morty. You're a good kid, and there's not a premium on that right now, but you'll be getting girls sometime after Brad's out of shape.",Jerry
"You're missing the point, Dad. I don't want girls, I want Jessica!",Morty
"Ahhh, well,  I remember feeling that way about a young lady named your mom, and that's not an urban dis, your mom was my Jessica. I remember the first time I saw her, I thought...",Jerry
"I should get her pregnant, then she'll have to marry me.",Rick
"I beg your pardon, Rick, INAPPROPRIATE.",Jerry
"Sorry, please proceed with your story about banging my daughter in high school.  I'm not sure you want to take romantic advice from this guy, Morty, his marriage is hanging from a thread.",Rick
"My marriage is fine, thank you.",Jerry
"Jerry, it's your house, whatever you say it is is how it is,  but I think a blind man could see that Beth is looking for the door. I barely have a reason to care and even I noticed.",Rick
"Come on, Rick, don't talk about my parents like that.",Morty
"Listen, Morty, I hate to break it to you, but what people call ""love"" is a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed. It hits hard, Morty, then it slowly fades, leaving you stranded in a failing marriage. I did it, your parents are gonna do it. Break the cycle, Morty. Rise above. Focus on science.",Rick
"Alright, well, I'm gonna go get dressed for the dance.",Morty
"Yeah, I'm just going to...check on your mom.",Jerry
"Morty, hand me that screwdriver, huh?  I'm almost finished making my ionic defibulizer, Morty. It's gonna be great.",Rick
"Hey, listen, Rick. You know how you said that, you know... love is a chemical and all that stuff from earlier?  Well, I was thinkn', you know, www... could you make some sort of chemical thing happen inside of Jessica's mind, you know, so where she falls in love with me and all that sort of thing, you know, like maybe make some sort of love potion or something?",Morty
"Morty, that's such a poor use of my time, it's beneath me. Hand me the screwdriver.",Rick
"YOU KNOW WHAT, NO RICK! I'M NOT GONNA HAND YOU THE SCREWDRIVER! Uh, I'm never gonna hand you anything ever again, Rick.  I'm always helping you with this and that and the other thing. Www...what about me, Rick? Www... why can't you just help me out once, once, for once?",Morty
"You're growing up fast, Morty. You're growing into a real big thorn straight up into my ass!  Listen, this is called oxytocin. I extracted it from a vole. You know what a VOLE is, Morty, you know what a vole is?",Rick
"It's a, it's a rodent that mates for life, Morty. This is the chemical release in the mammal's brain,  ...that makes it fall in love. Alright Morty, I just gotta  combine it with some of your DNA.",Rick
"Oh well, okay...",Morty
"A hair, Morty, I need one of your hairs! This isn't Game Of Thrones.",Rick
"Alright, Morty, whoever you smear this stuff on will fall in love with you, and only you, forever. Ya happy now, Morty?",Rick
"Heck yeah! Thank you, Grandpa Rick!  Hey there's no dangers or anything or side effects, right?",Morty
"Www.. what am I, a hack?! Go nuts, Morty, it's full proof.",Rick
"Ugh, unless she has the flu.",Rick
"Beth, do you still love me?",Jerry
Want kinda question is that?,Beth
"The ""yes"" or ""no"" kind.",Jerry
"Jerry, do you want homeless people to have homes?",Beth
Are you gonna build them?,Beth
"Then what good was the ""yes""?",Beth
"Wait, iii... is loving me the house or the homeless people?",Jerry
"Loving you is work, Jerry, hard work, like building a homeless shelter. Nobody want to say ""no"" to doing it, but some people put the work in. So what do ya say? Do you see me working here? Does this conversation seem tedious to me?",Beth
"But I obviously sort of love you, don't I?  So stop asking and maybe I'll love you more.  Crap, They need me at the horse hospital.",Beth
"The racetrack had a starlit derby, there's a seven horse collision, and Davin's there alone.",Beth
"Hey there, Jessica.  Whooa-whoopsie!",Morty
"Oh man. I love you too, Jessica!",Morty
"Oh, well, no problem Brad.",Morty
"Whoa, take it easy!",Morty
"Uh, sure. I mean, of course not. What do you think that was all about?",Morty
She's gonna be alone with that guy all night.,Jerry
"Yeah, Dad, digging around the inside of horses. It's not a very romantic setting.",Summer
"Rick? Are you far away, or are you inside something?",Morty
Rick? W-where are you?,Morty
"Are you invisible and you're gonna, like, fart on me?",Morty
"What, I'm gonna touch it, and you're gonna tell me it's an alien dick or something.",Morty
"Are you going to, I mean, you know, is this the first part of some magic trick?",Morty
"Well, can you move? Can you fly?",Morty
"All right, well, do pickles live forever or --",Morty
I-I'm just trying to figure out why you would do this. Why anyone would do this.,Morty
"Morty, we have to get going, or we're gonna be late. Where's your grandpa?",Beth
"What?! Why would you -- Look, we're running late. We have to go.",Beth
"We have an appointment downtown that was set a week ago and agreed upon by everyone, including you.",Beth
"Rick, did you do this on purpose to get out of family counseling?",Morty
Can't you just turn yourself back into a human?,Summer
"Nobody needs anything! Okay, it's fine. I mean, you should just stay here and figure out how to stop being a pickle, okay?",Beth
"Hey, Rick, why is there a syringe of mysterious fluid hanging directly over you? Also, why is the string attached to it running through a pair of scissors attached to a timer? And why is the time set to 10 minutes from now, exactly when we would have left for therapy?",Morty
"Enough. Kids, it's time to go. We don't want to be late.",Beth
"Well, I mean, you don't want to get pierced by a needle full of liquid unrelated to your situation. How's that gonna help?",Beth
Great. We'll see you later.,Beth
How is this even family therapy if Dad's not invited and Grandpa won't come?,Summer
"Yeah, and what's courageous about eating a hot dog?",Morty
"It's nobody's choice to be here, you knobs. The family was told to get counseling by your principal, even though it's not the family that was huffing pottery glaze in the art room and desk wetting in history class.",Beth
Temporarily. By order of the school.,Beth
We... have never... eaten poop.,Summer
"He got wrapped up in an experiment. He's a scientist. Like, legit, like on an inter-galactic, sci-fi level. His work is very --",Beth
He turned himself into a pickle.,Morty
"Morty, Mom's talking. I'm sorry, I suppose that's a good segue into our little discipline cases here.",Beth
"What? No, what kind of question is that?",Beth
"Oh, Jesus Christ, one of these. No, my father has never turned himself into a pickle before. He's unpredictable and eccentric. The whole family is. Speaking of which...",Beth
"I didn't say my father is perfect, I said his work is important.",Beth
And she's saying what's important is that Grandpa lied to you to get out of coming here.,Summer
"Oh, he did not!",Beth
Do you really not see what's happening here?,Beth
"Well, Dr. Wong -- by the way, racist name -- obviously, Morty and Summer are seizing on your arbitrary pickle obsession as an end run around what was supposed to be their therapy.",Beth
"Fuck both of you, too.",Beth
You're the one that costs $200 an hour. You tell me.,Beth
My kids pee their desks and suck on unbaked vases.,Beth
I never said I was angry at you.,Summer
"That's the point of pottery-enamel huffing, Summer. You do it so you don't have to say ""I'm angry at mommy"" out loud.",Beth
"Oh, my God!",Morty
"He won't have to ask for it, okay? He won't need it. He'll just make more. He doesn't need anything from anyone.",Beth
It's better than making your problems other people's problems.,Beth
I am afraid that my kids will get expelled.,Beth
I am mad that I can't huff enamel without people assuming it's because my family sucks. I hope to be seen one day as someone that just likes getting high.,Summer
I am sad that I peed. I'm sad that I peed in class instead of a toilet.,Morty
Dad I would like you to tell me what's in the syringe.,Beth
"Oh, it's fine. I mean, thank you, and, yeah, you shouldn't. But I hope you know that's not what that session was supposed to be.",Beth
"She huffed enamel, and we never even talked about it.",Beth
Are we gonna go back?,Summer
"Oh, my God, yes! Dad, it's in my purse. Oh, I'm sorry. You must be in agony.",Beth
"Man, I missed having hands and blood and a stomach.",Rick
"Really? Like, go somewhere? Yeah, let's drop the kids off and go tie one on.",Beth
"I, I liked her.",Morty
"So what are you thinking, like, Smokey's Tavern? Maybe Shoney's?",Beth
"Yeah, either one. Either one.",Rick
"You'll never get away with this, Concerto.",Rick
"This is it, Morty. We're goners. We're not getting out of this one. After everything we've been through, this is how we're gonna die. Make peace with your god.",Rick
"Oh, geez, Rick, I-I-I don't want to die!",Morty
"Who? Who was that, Rick?",Morty
"That, Morty, is why you don't go to therapy.",Rick
