Morty! You gotta come on. Jus'... you gotta come with me.,Rick
"I got a surprise for you, Morty.",Rick
It's the middle of the night. What are you talking about?,Morty
"Come on, I got a surprise for you.  Come on, hurry up.",Rick
Ow! Ow! You're tugging me too hard!,Morty
"We gotta go, gotta get outta here, come on. Got a surprise for you Morty.",Rick
"What do you think of this... flying vehicle, Morty? I built it outta stuff I found in the garage.",Rick
"Yeah, Rick... I-it's great. Is this the surprise?",Morty
"Morty. I had to... I had to do it. I had— I had to— I had to make a bomb, Morty. I had to create a bomb.",Rick
"We're gonna drop it down there just get a whole fresh start, Morty. Create a whole fresh start.",Rick
"Come on, Morty. Just take it easy, Morty. It's gonna be good. Right now, we're gonna go pick up your little friend Jessica.",Rick
"When I drop the bomb you know, I want you to have somebody, you know? I want you to have the thing. I'm gonna make it like a new Adam and Eve, and you're gonna be Adam.",Rick
"And so that's the surprise, Morty.",Rick
"No, you can't!  Jessica doesn't even know I exist! But—but, but forget about that, because you can't blow up humanity!",Morty
"I-I get what you're trying to say, Morty. Listen, I'm not...  You don't got... Y-you don’t gotta worry about me trying to fool around with Jessica or mess around with Jessica or anything. I'm not that kind of guy, Morty.",Rick
"What are you talking about, Rick?",Morty
"You-you don't have to worry about me getting with Jessica or anything. Sh-sh-she— she, she, she's all for you, Morty.",Rick
I don't care about Jessica! Y-Yyyyyyyyyyou—,Morty
"You know what, Morty? You're right.  Let's forget the girl altogether. She, she's probably nothing but trouble, anyways.",Rick
"That's it... that's it, Rick. I'm taking the wheel.",Morty
"I'm taking charge of this situation, buddy!  I'm put—I’m, I'm, I'm, I'm puttin’... I-I’m, I’m, I’m not gonna stand around like some sort of dumb... dumb person and just le-let you ruin the whole world!",Morty
"Come on! What’s gotten into you? If you love Earth so much why don’t you marry it?  What are you, crazy? Alright, alright, Morty.",Rick
Alright. I'll-I'll land. I'll land. I'll land. I'll land the thing. I’ll land the thing. Big tough guy all of a sudden.,Rick
"We'll park it right here, Morty. Right here on the side of the ree... road here.",Rick
"You know what? That was all a test, Morty. Just an elaborate test to make you more assertive.",Rick
"Sure. Why not? I don’t, I don't know. Y-you know what, Mo—",Rick
I see there's a new episode of that singing show tonight. Who do you guys think is gonna be the best singer?,Jerry
"Oh my God, his head is in his food. I'm going to puke.",Summer
"Morty, are you getting sick?  I told you not to practice-kiss the living room pillow. The dog sleeps on it.",Beth
"I wasn't kissing a pillow, mom. I just I didn't get a lot of sleep last night. Maybe my dreams were just too loud or something.",Morty
Or maybe you were out all night again with Grandpa Rick.,Summer
"What, so everyone's supposed to sleep every single night now? You realize that nighttime makes up half of all time?",Rick
"Oh my god, my parents are so loud, I want to die.",Summer
"Mm, there is no God, Summer. You gotta rip that band-aid off now. You'll thank me later.",Rick
"Okay, with all due respect, Rick— what am I talking about? What respect is due? How is my son supposed to pass his classes if you keep dragging him off for high-concept Sci-Fi rigamarole?",Jerry
"Listen, Jerry. I-I-I don't want to overstep my bounds or anything. It's your house. It's your world. You're a real Julius Caesar but I'll tell you something—tell you how I feel about school, Jerry. It's a waste of time.  Buncha people running around, bumping into each other. G-guy up front says, ""two plus two."" The people in the back say, ""four."" Then the—then the bell rings, and they give you a carton of milk and a piece of paper that says you can go take a dump or something. I mean, it's not a place for smart people, Jerry. And I know that's not a popular opinion, but it's my two cents on the issue.  This was a good breakfast, Beth. You really made the crap out of those eggs. I wish your mother was here to eat them.",Rick
Wow. Th-they're both great. Thank you!,Morty
"Uh, that's flattering... and a little weird.",Morty
"Wow. Well, okay, Jessica. L-let's give this a shot.",Morty
"Uh, I-I'm just doing my best.",Morty
"Oh, geez, Frank. I don't know if a knife is necessary. I mean, you know, y-you kind of had things handled without it.",Morty
"There you are, Morty. Listen to me. I got an errand to run in a whole different dimension. I need an extra pair of hands.",Rick
"Oh, geez, Rick. W-w-what'd you do to Frank?",Morty
"It's pretty obvious, Morty. I froze him. Now listen I need your help, Morty. I mean, we got we got to get get the hell out of here and go take care of business.  It's important. Come on, Morty.",Rick
"I don't know, Rick. I can't leave school again.",Morty
"Do you have any concept of how much higher the stakes get out there, Morty? What do you think I can just do it all by myself? Come on!",Rick
"Aw, geez. Okay. I guess I can skip history. What about Frank? I mean, shouldn't you unfreeze him?",Morty
"I'll do it later, Morty. He'll be fine. Let's go.",Rick
"My manager gave me an hour for lunch, and I thought, ""hey, why not swing by where your wife works?""",Jerry
"Jerry, please tell me you're here for an incredibly urgent reason.",Beth
"Well, it's lunch. I mean, it's one of three meals that have existed for millennia.",Jerry
"Okay, I only ask, Jerry, because, as you know, my job involves performing heart surgery.",Beth
"Okay, Let's not rehash that fight. I sense that you're busy and will now be on my way.",Jerry
"Whoa! What is this on the floor? Some kind of literature for a really nice-looking nursing home. Hey, honey, crazy idea bad pitch let's put your dad here. Let's put your dad in a nursing home.",Jerry
"Hey, Tom! We know when we're losing him. WE CAN HEAR THE BEEPS!",Beth
"There she is. All right. Come on, Morty. Let's go.",Rick
"Oh, man, Rick. What is this place?",Morty
"It's Dimension 35-C, and it's got the perfect climate conditions for a special type of tree, Morty, called a Mega Tree, and there's fruit in those trees, and there's seeds in those fruits. I'm talking about Mega Seeds. They're they're incredibly powerful, and I need them to help me with my research, Morty.",Rick
"Oh, man, Rick. I'm looking around this place, and I'm starting to work up some anxiety about this whole thing.",Morty
"All right, all right, calm down. Listen to me, Morty. I know that new situations can be intimidating. You're looking around, and it's all scary and different, but, you know, m-meeting them head on, charging right into them like a bull that's how we grow as people. I'm no stranger to scary situations. I deal with them all the time. Now, if you just stick with me, Morty, we're gonna be—",Rick
"I never seen that thing before in my life. I don't even know what the hell it is! We got to get out of here, Morty! It's gonna kill us! We're gonna die! We're gonna die, Morty!",Rick
"Oh, Morty, take a deep breath. Breathe that breathe that fresh air in, Morty. Y-you smell that? That's the smell of adventure, Morty. That's that's the smell of-of-of-of a whole different evolutionary timeline.",Rick
"All right, Rick, look how much longer is this gonna be? Shouldn't I be back at school by now?",Morty
"Are you joking me? I mean, look at all the crazy crap surrounding us. Look at that thing right there.  What the hell is that thing? You think you're gonna see that kind of thing at school?  Look at it just lumbering around.  It defies all logic, that thing.",Rick
"Yeah, Rick, I get it. We're surrounded by monsters. That's kind of the reason why I want to leave.",Morty
"You see what we just stumbled upon, Morty? Any idea what that is down there?",Rick
"That's right, Morty the mega trees with the mega fruit on them and that's what I'm talking about, Morty. That's where my seeds are. If we would have done what you wanted, I would have never have found them, because you're so in love with school.",Rick
"All right, all right. So, what's so special about these seeds, anyways?",Morty
"You ask a lot of questions, Morty. Not very charismatic. It makes you kind of an  under-  underfoot figure.",Rick
"Just take these shoes, Morty. They're  special grappling shoes. When you're wearing these things, these babies, you can basically just walk on any surface you want, Morty up, down, below, turn around to the left. These things really bring it all together.",Rick
"You have to turn them on, Morty! The shoes have to be turned on!",Rick
"I am not putting my father in a home! He just came back into my life, and you want to grab him and stuff him under a mattress like last month's Victoria's Secret?",Beth
"I told you I was ordering you something for Valentine's Day. More importantly, your father is a horrible influence on our son.",Jerry
"Since we're fighting, if you ever have an affair with that guy, I will come to the hotel room and blow my brains out all over your naked bodies.",Jerry
"Look, I appreciate the stress you're under, but Morty was having trouble in school way before my dad moved in, and the only influence I can see Rick having is that, for the first time in his life, Morty has a friend.",Beth
"Uh, yeah, maybe I am. I'm my father's daughter. I'm smart. Why do you think I'm a heart surgeon?",Beth
"Morty, oh, you really d-did a number on  your legs right now. You know, you got to turn  the shoes on, Morty, for them to work. Yeah, look I turned mine on. I had no problem getting down here. It was a leisurely breeze.",Rick
"I'm in a lot of pain, Rick!",Morty
"Yeah, I can see that. But do you think you'll still be able to help me collect my seeds, Morty?",Rick
"Are you kidding me?! That's it, Rick! That's the last straw! I can't believe this! I'm sitting here with both of my legs broken, and you're still asking me about getting those seeds?! Ooh! Ow! Oh! Y-y-you're a monster. Y-you're like Hitler, but-but even Hitler cared about Germany or something.",Morty
"Okay, hold on just a second, Morty.",Rick
Ooh! Ohh! Ooh! Hnngh! Hoo! Ooh! Ohh! Aaaaagh! Oooooh!,Morty
"Ooh, Ohh, Ooh. Wow, Rick. That stuff just healed my broken legs instantly. I mean, I've never felt so good in my life. Thank you.",Morty
"Don't worry about it, Morty. Just come help me get these seeds, all right, buddy?",Rick
"Not that you asked, Morty, but what just happened there is I went into a future dimension with such advanced medicine that they had broken-leg serum at every corner drugstore.  The stuff was all over the place, Morty.",Rick
"There's just one problem, Morty one little hang-up. The dimension I visited was so advanced, that  they had also halted the aging process, and everyone there was young, Morty, and they had been forever. I was the only old person there, Morty.  It was like I was some sort of, you know, celebrity, walking around. I-I was fascinating to them. There were a lot of attractive women there, Morty, and they-they-they— they all wanted time with me. I had a lot of fun with a lot of young ladies, but I spent so much time there, my interdimensional portal device it's got no charge left, Morty. It's got no charge left.",Rick
"It's as good as garbage, Morty. It's not gonna work anymore, Morty.",Rick
"Oh, geez, Rick, that's not good. W-what are we gonna do? I-I have to be back at school right now. How are we gonna get back home?",Morty
"There's ways to get back home, Morty. It's just it's just gonna be a little bit of a hassle. We're gonna have to go through interdimensional customs, so you're gonna have to do me a real solid.",Rick
"When we get to customs, I'm gonna need you to take these seeds into the bathroom, and I'm gonna need you to put them way up inside your butthole, Morty.",Rick
"Put them way up inside there, as far as they can fit.",Rick
"Oh, geez, Rick. I really don't want to have to do that.",Morty
"Well, somebody's got to do it, Morty. Th-these seeds aren't gonna get through customs unless they're in someone's rectum, Morty",Rick
"And they'll fall right out of mine. I've done this too many times, Morty. I mean, you're young. Y-y-you've got your whole life ahead of you, and your anal cavity is still taut, yet malleable. You got to do it for grandpa, Morty. Y-  you've got to put these seeds inside your butt.",Rick
"Come on, Morty. Please, Morty. You have to do it, Morty.",Rick
What? Why didn't you notify us?,Beth
"Boom! Told you! In your face! He is ruining our child! Wait, what am I celebrating?",Jerry
What kind of God lets this happen?,Summer
"I don't like it here, Morty. I can't abide bureaucracy. I don't like being told where to go and what to do. I consider it a violation. Did you get those seeds all the way up your butt?",Rick
"Yeah, Rick. Let's just get this over with, okay? I mean, these things are pointy. They hurt.",Morty
"That means they're good ones. You're a good kid, Morty. Those mega seeds are super valuable to my work. You've been a huge help to me. I'm gonna be able to do a-",Rick
Why does he have to go over there?,Rick
What new-  what new machine?,Rick
"Ooh! Oh, nice, Morty! The student becomes the teacher.",Rick
"I need to type in the coordinates to our home world, Morty. Cover me.",Rick
"Oh, man. I mean, you know, I-I don't want to shoot nobody.",Morty
"They're just robots, Morty! It's okay to shoot them! They're robots!",Rick
"It's a figure of speech, Morty. They're bureaucrats. I don't respect them. Just keep shooting, Morty. You have no idea what prison is like here!",Rick
"Come on, Morty! We got to get the hell out of here!",Rick
"Uh, yeah. Well, you know, my-my Ferrari's in the shop.  Just kidding.",Morty
"You can get his number later. Come on, Morty. We got to get out of here. You got to get those seeds out of your ass.",Rick
"Oh, look, honey. It's our son with Albert Ein-douche.",Jerry
"I'm an angry father, not an improviser.",Jerry
"Oh, hi, Jerry. Oh, my goodness, Morty! What are you doing out of class? We talked about this. Your-your parents and I are very disappointed in-in this behavior... No? No takers?",Rick
You guys should really not be touching that stuff. It's beyond your reasoning.,Rick
"Dad, how could you make my son miss an entire semester of school? I mean, it's not like he's a hot girl. He can't just bail on his life and set up shop in someone else's.",Beth
What what are you guys doing with my stuff?,Rick
We're moving you to a nursing home.,Beth
"A nursing home? What are what are you, nuts? I'm a genius. I build robots for fun.",Rick
"Well, now you can build baskets and watch Paul Newman movies on VHS and mentally scar the Boy Scouts every Christmas.",Jerry
"Dad, mom, come on. Rick just needed my help is all.",Morty
"Morty, stay out of this. You are obviously not capable of judging these situations on your own.",Jerry
What are you trying to say about Morty? That he's stupid or something?,Rick
"Oh, don't high-road us, dad. You know fully well that Morty is the last child that needs to be missing classes.",Beth
I-I-I don't know what you mean by that. Can can can you be a little bit more specific?,Rick
"Oh, for crying out—he's got some kind of disability or something. Is that what you want us to say?",Jerry
"Well, duh doy, son. Look, I love you, Morty, but we both know you're not as fast as the other kids, and if you want to compete in this world, you got to work twice as hard.",Jerry
"Aw, geez, dad. Y-you know, that's a lot to drop on a kid all at once.",Morty
"Morty, t-tell your parents the square root of pi.",Rick
"Oh, come on, Rick. You know I can't.",Morty
"The square root of Pi, Morty. Go!",Rick
"Morty, tell your parents the first law of Thermodynamics.",Rick
"""The increment in the internal energy of a system is equal to the increment of heat supplied to the system."" Wow! I'm so smart!",Morty
I told the both of you school is stupid. It's not how you learn things. Morty's a gifted child. He has a special mind. That's why he's my little helper. He's like me. He's gonna be doing great science stuff later in his life. He's too smart for school. He needs to keep hanging out and helping me.,Rick
"Jerry, I don't want whatever's happening here to stop.",Beth
"No, I-I understand. Uh, maybe we overreacted. But he has to keep going to school.",Jerry
"Okay, Jerry. You drive a hard bargain, but what am I supposed to do? Say no? You-you really wear the pants around here. I just want you to know, between us, from now on, it's gonna be clear communication.",Rick
Frank Palicky was frozen to death today!,Summer
No idea what you're talking about.,Rick
"Okay. Well, uh, Morty, it's your bedtime in an hour. Don't stay up all night again. This is good, though. This can work. I think we can be a family and now, Beth, if you'll have me, I would love to have you.",Jerry
"Holy cow, Rick. I didn't know hanging out with you was making me smarter.",Morty
"Full disclosure, Morty it's not. Temporary superintelligence is just a side effect of the mega seeds dissolving in your rectal cavity.",Rick
"Yeah, and once those seeds wear off, you're gonna lose most of your motor skills, and you're also gonna lose a significant amount of brain functionality for 72 hours, Morty.",Rick
"Ohh, man.  Oh, geez! Ohh.",Morty
"I'm sorry, Morty. It's a bummer. In reality, you're as dumb as they come and I needed those seeds real bad, and I had to give them up just to get your parents off my back, so now we're gonna have to go get more adventures.  And then we're gonna go on even more adventures after that, Morty and you're gonna keep your mouth shut about it, Morty, because the world is full of idiots that don't understand what's important, and they'll tear us apart, Morty but if you stick with me, I'm gonna accomplish great things, Morty, and you're gonna be part of them, and together, we're gonna run around, Morty. We're gonna do all kinds of wonderful things, Morty. Just you and me, Morty. The outside world is our enemy, Morty. We're the only friends we've got, Morty. It's just Rick and Morty. Rick and Morty and their adventures, Morty. Rick and Morty forever and forever. Morty's things. Me and Rick and Morty running around, and Rick and Morty time. All day long, forever. All a hundred days. Rick and Morty forever 100 times. Over and over, rickandmortyadventures.com. All 100 years. Every minute, rickandmorty.com.",Rick
What? Why are you looking at me? You want to go outside? Outside?,Jerry
Are you kidding me?! Come on!,Jerry
"Oh, he he didn't mean it, dad. Did you, snuffles? You're a good boy.",Morty
"Don't praise him now, Morty! He just peed on the carpet! Bad dog! Bad!",Jerry
"Morty, come on. I need your help tonight.",Rick
"Hey, wait, hold on a second, Rick. You wouldn't by any chance have some sort of crazy science thing you could whip up that might help make this dog a little smarter, would you?",Jerry
"I thought the whole point of having a dog was to feel superior, Jerry. If I were you, I wouldn't pull that thread. Come on, Morty.",Rick
"Listen, Rick, if you're gonna stay here rent-free and use my son for your stupid science, the least you could do is put a little bit of it to use for the family. You make that dog smart or Morty's grounded!",Jerry
"Boy, you really got me up against a wall this time, Jerry.",Rick
"All right, Ruffles What's his name?",Rick
"Yeah, you're at the top of your game now, Jerry. Have fun. Come on, Morty.",Rick
"Yeah, Morty, if you like that, boy, you're you're really going to flip your lid over this one.",Rick
"It's a device, Morty, that when you put it in your ear, you can enter people's dreams, Morty. It's just like that movie that you keep crowing about.",Rick
"That's right, Morty. This is gonna be a lot like that, except, you know, it's gonna may--be make sense.",Rick
"You don't have to try to impress me, Morty. Listen, tonight we're gonna go into the home of your math teacher, Mr. Goldenfold, and we're gonna incept the idea in his brain to give you A's in math, Morty. That way you can, you know, y-you're gonna help me with my science, Morty, all the time.",Rick
"Geez, Rick, in the time it took you to make this thing, couldn't you have just, you know, helped me with my homework?",Morty
"Are you listening to me, Morty? Homework is stupid. The whole point is to get less of it.",Rick
"Come on, let's just get over there and deal with this thing. W-we're gonna incept your teacher. You're frustrating me.",Rick
"Wow, Rick, I can't believe we're sitting around, standing around in Mr. Goldenfold's house. It's really weird.",Morty
"It's about to get a whole lot weirder, Morty.",Rick
"All right, Morty, time to make our move.",Rick
Allahu  akbar! We're gonna take control of this plane! We're gonna 9/11 it unless Morty Smith gets better grades in math!,Rick
"Hey! I said nobody move, buddy!",Rick
"Goldenfold's got more control here than I anticipated. I mean, the guy teaches high-school math.  I didn't take him for an active dreamer. We've got to take him out so he wakes up, Morty but we can't get killed. If you get killed in someone else's dream, you die for real, Morty.",Rick
What?! Are you kidding me?! Ohhhhhh!,Morty
"Don't be a baby! You avoid getting shot in real life all the time, Morty. Just do the same thing here, and we'll be fine!",Rick
This is what I'm talking about. This is a dog.,Jerry
"You said the same thing, equally sarcastically, at our wedding and guess what?",Jerry
"Oh, my God! He's trying to tell us something.  That is so awesome.",Summer
"Aw, he's saying ""I love lasagna"".",Jerry
"He's saying ""I love Obama"".  So cute! I'm posting this  online, like, right now.",Summer
I should call Bob Saget. Is that still a thing?,Jerry
"Goldenfold, we're coming out! We just want to talk!",Rick
Because we're both rational adults that don't want anything bad to happen. And because I have a human shield.,Rick
"Oh, no, Morty. His subconscious is panicking.",Rick
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoooooaaaa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoooooaaaa!,Rick
"Relax, Morty. Look! Mrs. Pancakes has a parachute. Come on!",Rick
"Oh, no, Rick, look! Goldenfold landed the plane, and he's created a  mechanical arm to pluck Mrs. Pancakes out of the air while he lets us fall - into a giant vat of lava!",Morty
"Pretty concise, Morty. Looks like we've merely prolonged the inevitable. That's it, Morty! Prolonging the inevitable! Listen, if we go into Mrs. Pancakes' dream, everything will go 100 times slower, Morty. That'll buy us some time to figure this out!",Rick
"Oh, man, Rick, this is pretty weird.",Morty
"Okay. All right, well Look, Mrs. Pancakes is right over there. I'll just go ask her to tell goldenfold not to kill us when she wakes up.",Morty
"Whoa, whoa, Morty, the trick to incepting is making people think they came up with the idea. Listen to me. If we're gonna incept Mrs. Pancakes, we have to blend. I'll talk to you after lunch.",Rick
"Hey, there, stranger. What do you think of these things?",Summer
"Whoa, whoa, whoa! What's the matter with you, Morty? Calm down! You're kind of killing the vibe in here.",Rick
"Can you blame him? Come on, old man, little boy. Let's make an inter-generational sandwich.",Summer
"Time to go another dream deep, Morty!",Rick
What the hell? Why would Mr. Goldenfold's dream version of Mrs.,Morty
"Geez, I don't know, Morty. Wha-what do you want from me?",Rick
Looks like some sort of legally safe knock-off of an '80s horror character with miniature swords for fingers instead of knives.,Rick
"Whoa! Hey, buddy. What you got going on there?",Jerry
Humans understand snuffles now? That is awesome!,Summer
"Okay, yeah. I get what Beth was talking about. Fun's over.",Jerry
"Whoa, dad, you can't, like, endow a creature with sentience and then rip it away.",Summer
I don't know. It's Indian giving.,Summer
"Aw! Oh, my God! He recognizes the other dogs on TV.",Summer
"Holy crap! We have to escape into someone else's dreams, Morty!",Rick
"Oh, man, oh, man, oh, man!",Morty
"Are you kidding me? This again? Oh, man, it looks like we've hit dream bedrock here, Morty.",Rick
"Oh, geez, Rick. W-w-whoa, this isn't good.",Morty
"Holy crap, Morty. He can travel through dreams. He can travel through dreams! We're so screwed!",Rick
"Okay, Snowball, just calm down, okay? You're scaring me.",Summer
"Hey. Oh, wow. Okay, is is is everything okay in here?",Jerry
What are we here for again? Incepting? We're trying to incept-,Rick
"We're trying to incept me to get an ""A"" in math?",Morty
"Man, he sure says ""bitch"" a lot!",Morty
"Hold on, Morty. Y-you know what? He keeps saying we can run but we can hide. I say we try hiding.",Rick
But that's the opposite of what-,Morty
"Yeah, well, since when are we taking this guy's advice on anything?",Rick
"Hey, you know what? You got a really good point there, Rick. Like, if the truth was that we could hide, it's not like he'd be sharing that information with us, you know? I-I-I think it's a good idea, Rick.",Morty
Worst-case scenario we're back to running.,Rick
"Wow, you know what? I mean, it looks like we could have just hid this whole time. Boy, Rick, that was some good thinking.",Morty
"Thanks, Morty. Yeah, it's nice to be on the same page every once in a while.",Rick
"Oh, this is perfect, Morty. Look at that. He's getting sleepy. Just a little bit longer before he calls it a day. That's when we make our move.",Rick
"Snuffles, we didn't mean you any harm! This is a huge misunderstanding.",Jerry
"Dad, he wants to be called snowball.",Summer
"Well, I'm not calling him that. That's ridiculous.",Jerry
Huh! You think you can control me with a haircut?,Jerry
"Morty, this is perfect. After a little scary coitus, they should be fast asleep and then we'll incept him.",Rick
Looks like scary Terry's having a nightmare.,Rick
"Oh, boy, Rick. I can only imagine what horrible things must, you know scare Scary Terry.",Morty
"Yeah, this is a bunch of bullcrap. Who cares what stupid pun you make when you kill someone? Why don't you let the poor guy say whatever he wants?",Rick
"You're putting too much pressure on yourself, scary Terry. You know, I mean, y-you're perfectly scary enough as it is.",Rick
"Hey, yo, scary T., don't even trip about your pants dawg. Here's a pair on us, fool.",Morty
"You don't need to say anything. We got you, dawg.",Morty
"You're our boy, dawg. Don't even trip.",Rick
"As a matter of fact, Terry, there is something you could help us with.",Rick
"Out of the frying pan dot, dot, dot, huh, Morty?",Rick
"Well, it's possible that your dog became self-aware and made modifications on the cognition amplifier, then turned on Jerry, Beth, and Summer after learning about humanity's cruel subjugation of his species, but your guess is as good as mine, Morty.",Rick
I can't believe how mean snuffles got just because he's smart.,Jerry
This is why I choose to get C's.,Summer
If we hurry we can set up camp in a sewer tunnel or something before the dogs completely take over.,Rick
"Whoa, whoa, whoa. We're not going anywhere. This is my house. I'm not abandoning it.",Jerry
"It's all over, Jerry. The dogs are on a path to total world domination. But, hey, at least they know not to piss on your carpet, right?",Rick
"Wait a minute. I have an idea. Gentlemen, a moment of your time.  See that? I'm peeing all over your special guns. That means I own them.",Jerry
"Mmm. Thank you, Fido. Rick! I thought you were dead!",Morty
"No, no, no, I was just playing dead. Good news, though, Morty. This whole thing's gonna be over really soon.",Rick
"It's a dream, Morty. We're in your dog's dream. The night the dogs captured us, after you cried and crapped your pants, we all went to sleep. Then I used my dream inceptors to put the two of us inside snuffles' dream.",Rick
But I-it's been like a whole year!,Morty
"It's been six hours. Dreams move one one-hundredth the speed of reality, and dog time is one-seventh human time. So, you know, every day here is like a minute. It's like ""Inception,"" Morty, so if it's confusing and stupid, then so is everyone's favorite movie.",Rick
"Aw, man. I really liked this life. Well, at least I didn't really crap my pants.",Morty
"No, no, that happened before you went to sleep, Morty. You're sleeping in your crap right now. Out of all the things that happened to you, that was the only real thing that, you know, is that you crapped your pants. I mean, it's a mess out there. I got some on my hands, Morty, and then I got it on the dream inceptor, and a piece fell in my mouth.",Rick
"Look, d-d-d-don't worry about it, Morty. Here, here take these, Morty. Take these.",Rick
"Are these pills supposed to wake me up, or something?",Morty
Close. It's gonna make your kidneys shut down.,Rick
"It's necessary for the plan, Morty. Don't even trip, dawg.",Rick
"I'm sorry. It's just like the end of ""Old Yeller.",Jerry
"Oh, Jerry. You mean because it had dogs in it.",Beth
"Wow! A whole world populated by intelligent dogs. I wonder what it'll be like, Rick.",Morty
"I think it will be great, Morty. You know it could be developed in-into a very satisfying project for people of all ages. I mean, I'd watch it, Morty, for at least 11 minutes a pop. You know, may-maybe they'll do it board-driven.",Rick
"You know, that's a real comforting idea, Rick.",Morty
"What do you know, Morty? What do you know?",Rick
"Oooh! This is how you dream, bitch.",Rick
"Hurry up Morty, Grampa's about to unfreeze time. You know you really should be cleaning from top to bottom.",Summer
"I know how to vacuum Mom and Dad, Summer, I've been doing it for six months!",Morty
"Then you've been doing it wrong for six months. Oh, my God, is that mildew?",Summer
It's not my fault we froze time on a humid day!,Morty
"You have dropped so many balls, man. Do you ever get scared Grampa Rick might make me his new sidekick?",Summer
What? What kind of monster are you?,Morty
Who cares about the  thing you guys are talking about? The whole point of freezing time is to stop giving a fuck. Put a shirt on your dumb dad and let's get this dumb universe rolling. Let's do this thing.,Rick
"Alright, listen, you two, we froze time for a pretty long time, so when I unfreeze it, the world's time is gonna be fine, but our time's gonna need a little time to, you know, stabilize.",Rick
Our time is gonna be unstable? What does that even mean?,Morty
"It means relax and stop being a pussy, Morty. I thought you learned that by now. It also means don't touch your parents or we could shatter into countless theoretical shards.",Rick
"Uh, did we ever put that mattress under Mr. Benson?",Morty
"...A THING OR TWO ABOUT... wait, what? Was the house...? When we pulled up I could have sworn the house was completely trashed.",Jerry
"Negative visualization, Jerry. It explains a lot about where you're at. Hi, sweety.",Rick
W-We just missed you a lot.,Morty
"Yeah, we missed you so much. Too much to hug you though.",Summer
"Yeah it would literally destroy them. Now listen, why do—why do—why—why don't you guys go get a free sunday ice cream,  go out there and get some ice creams. Here's five hundred dollars cash in unmarked moneys. I'm just gonna put it on the floor and uh, kick it on over to ya. You guys go nuts.",Rick
"This better not be a bribe. If I find a single thing out of place in this house, my love of ice cream won't save you. I'll get my jacket.",Jerry
"Sweety, is your shirt on backwards?",Beth
"Yeah, I like it this way. I'm not stupid.",Jerry
"Man that guy is the Red Grin Grumble to pretending he knows what's going on.  Oh you agree, huh?  You like that Red Grin Grumble reference?  Well guess what? I made him up. You really are your father's children. Think for yourselves, don't be sheep.",Rick
"Yup, it really makes you appreciate how fickle the universe can be.   One minute you're falling off a roof for six months, the next minute, bam!",Rick
"Uh, just to be clear, it was Summer's job to put the mattress under-",Morty
"Uh, what? It was your job, Morty.",Summer
"Actually, sorry Summer, I gotta back the M bomb on this one. I remember the conversation. We told Morty to replace all the bank's money with cookies, your job was to put the mattress under Mr. Benson.",Rick
"Boom! In your face Summer! You really dropped the ball, man.",Morty
"Shut up Morty, you vindictive little turd!",Summer
You shut up you big... female asshole!,Morty
Whoa whoa wh-what the hell hell hell hell hell?,Rick
Were either of you guys uncertain about anything just now?,Rick
Cold Stone Creamery is the best. What should we do with our remaining twenty dollars?,Jerry
You realize they sing no matter how much you tip.,Beth
I hit a deer! W-we have to tell the cops you were driving.,Jerry
"Well, do we- do I uh, get a big rock? Or--",Jerry
"I thought that's what a man's supposed to say, it's not like I could have actually done it.",Jerry
"If we were near a hospital, I could treat it, but I-I think we have to just-",Beth
"It's okay, this is just something that happens. And even if we were in a hospital, what could we do, you're a horse surgeon, not a deer surgeon.",Jerry
Require different levels of skill to keep alive?,Beth
"Get the deer in the car, Jerry.",Beth
"Huh, what do you know, it's working",Rick
"I'm a certified horse surgeon, and this deer needs medical attention. Nurse, please move that snake.",Beth
"As a vet, I'm sure you know a deer is closer to a horse than you are to a doctor, so let's save the measuring for when our dicks are out, it's time to save a life!",Beth
"Uh, yeah, I was there, you don't have to rub it in.",Jerry
I mean it's been shot. With a gun.,Beth
"You son of a bitch, you don't stop living until I SAY SO!",Beth
"Jerry, if you're not gonna help, get the fuck out of here! I will reach into heaven and yank your screaming deer soul back!",Beth
"Yes, we're back to our own time.",Summer
"Yes no more cats, no more cats, oh you did it, you fixed it.",Morty
How long exactly do we have to wear these things? They're really embarassing.,Rick
You stole a time freezing crystal from testical monsters?,Summer
"I would have been happy to pay for it, Summer, but they don't exactly sell them at Costco. Besides, there's a larger lesson to be learned here. Get him!",Rick
Isn't there a kitten somewhere that needs a manicure?,Beth
"Honey, it's gonna be okay. These men are from the Cervine Institute of Elk, Moose Deer and Stag. They can take this deer to a helicopter and fly it to the country's top deer surgeon on a wildlife reserve across the state border, where your jurisdiction ends.",Jerry
What if I told you there's a huge ticket up right behind you?,Rick
"Alright, hear me out on this. You're immortal, right, which means your life is infinite. Well in that case there's 100% chance that you'll eventually do everything, including turning around to look behind you.",Rick
"Summer, Morty, take off your collars!",Rick
Good question. I suppose the answer is,Rick
"Look, I know I was kind of a nuisance today. I know it's my fault we hit the deer, and I know you wanted to be the one to save it.",Jerry
Whatever. How petty would I have to be to care less about an animal's life than my own ego?,Beth
Hmm... you'd have to be pretty petty. But you'd still be the woman I married.,Jerry
There is no helicopter and there is no Cervine Institute.,Jerry
I'm looking at her. Thanks for F.D.'ing me up like that.,Jerry
"Jerry, this was the most romantic weekend I've ever had.",Beth
"Oh, that was a close call. Oh yeah, do it Rick, do it right.",Morty
"You know what I'm talking about, oh yeah. I'm gonna do the cabbage patch, Morty. Check me out I'm doing the cabbage patch dance. It's a classic dance, remember, like this. Oh shit look at that.",Rick
Do the cabbage patch. Do—do—do the dance.,Morty
"Hey wait a second, how come you guys took longer to get here?",Summer
I don't know. I think like one sixty-fourth of my collars didn't work. It's hard to keep straight now that I have sixty-three other memories of everything.,Morty
"But I feel like one of the sixty-four Ricks like, sacrificed himself for me, maybe, I think.",Morty
"Shut up, Morty. The last time you felt something, we all almost died. You little s—piece of shit.",Rick
"Hey guys, we're home.Morty & Summer",Beth
"Um, hold the phone, where did you guys get those necklaces from? Uh, Lady Gaga, table for three, am I right?",Jerry
"Are you guys Power Rangers? But only on one small part of your necks? Hey, do those things need batteries? Were they included? Clean up in the fruit isle! Not in a homophobic way though, they're just fruity necklaces is all I was saying.",Jerry
"Doesn't feel so good, does it?",Morty
"Somebody call the planet of Tron, we have three Tron people over here. But seriously, are these Halloween costumes? Are you going as motorcycles? With green headlights instead of normal ones? Are you dogs? Robot dogs? Gosh, you guys are lame. Are those chokers from the 90's? What is this, a 90's nostalgia thing? Are you guys in that movie “The Craft” with Fairuza Balk?",Jerry
The trick to cereal is keeping 70% of it above the milk.,Jerry
"Uh, w-why don't you get it Jerry? you're the man of the house and you don't have a job.",Rick
"Ughhhh... belchflies towards front doorTurning back around and re-entering dining roomScoffsHovers over Jerry and fully shoves him into underside before flying away through open front door and into skyRuns to front doorFollow BethLooking into skyStill eating cerealUnscrewing and drinking from scotch flaskMorty waveskissing Beth's handHolding a suit in a dry cleaning bag* Your language has 'squanch,' in it a lot. Doesn't that become tedious and worn out like the Smurf thing?",Rick
"Beth, Squanchy culture is more... contextual than literal. You just say what's in your squanch and people understand.",Rick
"Oh, okay... I squanch my family.",Beth
"What? I do, I squanch my family.",Beth
"Anyway, that's how I escaped from space prison! Oh, scary place.",Rick
"Wow, Rick! That's -- That's one -- one heck of a story. I sure do wish I could have been there to see it happen.",Morty
"Oh, come on. Who wants to watch a mad scientist use handmade sci-fi tools to take out highly trained alien guards when we can sit here and be a family at Shoney's?",Rick
"Dad, it's great to have you back, no matter where we are, but wouldn't you like to go home?",Beth
"Emotionally speaking, honey, Shoney's is my home.",Rick
"Yeah, but you just got out of prison. I mean, how much of a step up from that is --",Jerry
"Jerry, get out of the booth, take all your clothes off, and fold yourself 12 times.",Rick
"Six folds, huh? W-W-What, have you guys got me in a Series 9000? You cheap insect fucks didn't think I was worth your best equipment?",Rick
"Well, you might as well order some pancakes, because I don't see the need to leave this part of my brain.",Rick
"I tell ya, the Galactic Federation taking over Earth -- best thing that's ever happened to this family. I just got my sixth promotion this week, and I still don't know what I do.",Jerry
Who cares how high they promote you? Everyone just gets paid in pills.,Summer
"Well, when you're not sure what you do for a living, you can make your own rules.",Jerry
"Summer, show your father some respect. He's pulling down a six-chewable figure income.",Beth
"I kind of had big pills for lunch, and I  wasn't gonna eat any more pills.  Thank you, Conroy.",Morty
Grandpa Rick wouldn't put up with this!,Summer
Stop saying his name! He abandoned us.,Beth
Willem Dafoe! Th-That's the guy I couldn't think of this morning.,Jerry
"Don't make my mistake, Summer. Don't deify the people that leave you. You'll end up a horse surgeon in a world controlled by aliens whose medicine keeps horses  healthy forever.  Horses live longer than tortoises now. Is that what you want for yourself?",Beth
Maybe I just want you to care if I run away yelling!,Summer
"Oh, any particular ones? You want to see my first boner, or should we go straight to the moment I discovered interdimensional travel?",Rick
"' Ooh, your little flappy doodles are twitching. Does that mean you're aroused, or did you just get a signal that one of your buddies found a grape?",Rick
"Well, that depends on who breaks first -- me or the titty.",Rick
The day I invented the portal gun is the day I lost her.,Rick
Huh? What are you -- What are you doing?,Morty
"Grandpa Rick must have some secret lab, right? With, like, laser guns and jets packs and a space tank! And we can go break him out of prison! Look at these dead flies! Maybe if we arrange them in a certain order, it plays a hologram or it opens a secret door.",Summer
"Summer, you're freaking me out. I know things have changed a lot, and I know you miss Rick, but getting him back wouldn't make things better. And, you know, we're not doing so bad.",Morty
"We're miserable, Morty! There's a mandatory curfew, their weird calendar made me 47, and they weaponized the Eiffel Tower!",Summer
"Hey, I like being 35. I-I can rent a car now.",Morty
"Because you suck! You've been keeping your lip zipped about it since Grandpa got arrested, but the fact is, you're freaking stoked to bail on him.",Summer
"He bails on everybody! He bailed on Mom when she was a kid! He -- He bailed on tiny planet! And in case I never made this clear to you, Summer, he bailed on you. He left you to rot in a world that he ruined because he doesn't care! Because nobody's special to him, Summer, not even himself. So, if you really want your grandpa back, grab a shovel. The one that won't let you down is buried in your backyard!",Morty
"What?! No, I'm not right. I-I was using ghoulish overkill! Ghoulish overkill, Summer!",Morty
"Oh, God! Oh, God! Whoa, whoa!",Morty
To the day it all began and ended. The moment that changed everything.,Rick
"Yeah, I'd like to get a 10-piece McNugget and a bunch of the Szechuan sauce. Like, as much as you're allowed to give me. In 1998, they had this promotion for the Disney film ""Mulan,"" where they -- where they -- they created a new sauce for the McNuggets called Szechuan sauce, and it's delicious! And then they got rid of it, and now it's gone. This is the only place we're gonna be able to try it, is in my memory.",Rick
Me. I used to wear blue pants.,Rick
"Summer, nobody has to know about that. We could put it right back and pretend we never saw it, like we did with Dad's mannequin leg.",Morty
"Fine, stay here. I'll rescue Grandpa myself.",Summer
And how are you gonna do that?,Morty
I don't know yet. I'll make it up as I go. That's what Grandpa Rick does. That's what heroes do.,Summer
"Y-You want to see what a hero Rick is? I-I'll bring you somewhere, Summer. Um-",Morty
"What is this place? And what's with ""Hunger Games"" Summer?",Summer
That's my sister. This used to be my home.,Morty
"Good roasted Cronenberg, I assume. Mom, you're looking feral. I can't believe Rick did this.",Summer
"These are the parts of Rick's adventures you don't get to see -- the parts he leaves behind. All right, it's been great, guys. I really only wanted to stop by here for a quick ""I told ya so."" So, uh--",Morty
What are you doing with that?!,Morty
No! Why?! Why would you do that?! W-W-What is the matter with you people?!,Morty
Hold your fire! Hold your fire! I'm Morty C-137.,Morty
He got captured by the Federation and we were going to rescue him.,Summer
Yeah. That's the three lines of math that separates my life as a man from my life as an unfeeling ghost.,Rick
"Because the code you just uploaded wasn't actually my portal-gun formula, it was a virus giving me full control over the brainalyzer.",Rick
"True, but you can alter anything you want about a totally fabricated origin story.",Rick
"Mission accomplished, boys. Pull me out.",Rick
"Okay, have fun in what's left of my brain. I'm gonna transfer to yours. Oh, there's not enough room for all my genius, so I'm leaving you with my fear of wicker furniture, my desire to play the trumpet, my tentative plans to purchase a hat, and six years of improv workshops. Comedy comes in threes.",Rick
It's the Citadel of Ricks. All the different Ricks from all the different realities got together to hide here from the government.,Morty
"But if every Rick hates the government, why would they hate Grandpa?",Summer
Because Ricks hate themselves the most. And our Rick is the most himself.,Morty
How is this a fair trial? O-Our lawyer is a Morty.,Morty
"I say fuck you! My grandpa was my hero. You killed him because you were jealous of him. That's pretty obvious from the haircuts. So do what you want to me, but let my brother go. He already renounced Rick.",Summer
"What? N-No, I don't want to see your Pog collection. I don't renounce Rick, and I never have. I was just trying to protect my sister. I wanted you to have a normal life. That's something you can't have when Rick shows up. Everything real turns fake. Everything right is wrong. All you know is that you know nothing and he knows everything. And, well -- well, he's not a villain, Summer, but he shouldn't be your hero. He's more like a demon or a super fucked up god.",Morty
"Oh, yeah? If you think my Rick's dead, he's alive. And if you think you're safe, he's coming for you!",Morty
"Morty, take this. You're gonna need it later.",Rick
What -- What's this supposed to accomplish? We have infinite grandkids. You're trying to use Disney bucks at a Caesar's Palace here.,Rick
"That's a bluff. He's bluffing, sir. He loves me.",Summer
"I came to kill you, bro. That's not even my original Summer.",Rick
"Oh, my God. He's not bluffing. He's not bluffing!",Summer
"20 yards, nine-gauge plasma pistol, My first shot would liquify her insides and injure you, second shot adds recoil. The risk to me is minimized if I wait for you to shoot her, which I'm encouraging you to do.",Rick
"Or let her go, which I will reward with a quicker death.",Rick
"Because it's incentive for you to give me my cleanest shot, which will be your least painful death. But if you want to die slower than that, I'm super into it. All you got to do to get that started is kill the girl.",Rick
"That's enough! Drop the gun, Rick!",Morty
"Morty, I know you're too stupid to get this, but you're really fuckin' this up right now.",Rick
I'm not letting you let my sister die! Drop the gun!,Morty
"I wasn't gonna let her die, you fuckin' moron!",Rick
The point is he thought I was going to.,Rick
"You're a serious fuckin' idiot, Morty! You basically killed us all! You're the worst! You're as dumb as a bag of sand.",Rick
"Morty, we just got him back!",Summer
"Good job, Morty. Let's go, kids.",Rick
Oldest Rick trick in the book.,Rick
"""Fake gun, shoot me in standoff."" Brilliant.",Summer
"Ha, yeah. G-Good thing I saw that note.",Morty
Not until I finish what I started. And that is how you get level-nine access without a password.,Rick
"Employee of the month, ladies and gentlemen.",Rick
"So, what are you doing with level-nine access anyways?",Morty
Are you going to set all their nukes to target each other?,Summer
"Ooh, or -- or reprogram their military portals to disintegrate their entire space fleet?",Morty
"Good pitches, kids. I'm almost proud. But watch closely as Grandpa topples an empire by changing a one to a zero.",Rick
"Jerry, what the hell is happening?!",Beth
"Look, I-I'm not proud to share this, but the truth is, I just kept crawling, and it kept working.  Oh, I'm glad you're okay. Are we ever going to stop paying for indulging your father? Our children, our planet, our jobs? Is there anything left to lose?",Jerry
"Just each other, and I'll never let you go. And I'm so sorry I ever did this to us.",Beth
I was right. He turned himself in on purpose. It was all part of his plan!,Summer
"Jerry, is there any light beer left? It's insane what you miss in prison.",Rick
"Um..okay. No. No, no, no. Foot down time.",Jerry
"No, you're right. Where's the vodka?",Rick
"Seems like you guys need some privacy. I'll, uh -- I'll be in the garage.",Rick
"What the fuck? Not cool, Jerry! A man's garage is his castle.",Rick
Jerry's going to spend some time divorced.,Beth
"Oh, I-I'm sorry to hear that, sweetie. I hope I had nothing to do with that.",Rick
"Oh, God, Dad, that is not your burden to bear. I feel terrible that I misjudged you. This is gonna be good for Jerry.",Beth
I better tend to Jerry before he changes his mind and doesn't move out. I will leave you two to your adventures.,Beth
"Oh, my God. Nancy says they're drawing and quartering aliens in the school courtyard, and it technically counts as patriotism.",Summer
"Geez! Are my parents seriously gonna get divorced? All right, Rick, I'm gonna go to my --",Morty
"Not so fast, Morty. You heard your mom. We've got adventures to go on, Morty -- just you and me -- and sometimes your sister and sometimes your mom, but never your dad. You want to know why, Morty? Because he crossed me.",Rick
"Okay, take it easy, Rick. T-T-That's dark.",Morty
"Oh, it gets darker, Morty. Welcome to the darkest year of our adventures. First thing that's different -- no more Dad, Morty.",Rick
"He threatened to turn me in to the government, so I made him and the government go away.",Rick
I've replaced them both as the de facto patriarch of your family and your universe. Your mom wouldn't have accepted me if I came home -,Rick
"- without you and your sister, so now you know the real reason I rescued you. Oh! I just took over the family, Morty, and if you tell your mom -",Rick
"- or sister I said any of this, I'll deny it -",Rick
"- and they'll take my side because I'm a hero, Morty. And now you're gonna have to go -",Rick
"- and do whatever I say, Morty, forever! And I'll -- I'll go out and I'll find some more of that ""Mulan"" Szechuan teriyaki dipping sauce, Morty. -",Rick
"- Because that's -- that's what this is all about, Morty.",Rick
"That's my one-armed man! I'm not driven by avenging my dead family, Morty! That was fake. I-I-I'm driven by finding that McNugget sauce.",Rick
"I want that ""Mulan"" McNugget sauce, Morty! That's my series arc, Morty.",Rick
"If it takes nine seasons, I want my McNugget dipping sauce, Szechuan sauce, Morty.",Rick
"What are you talking about, Rick?",Morty
"That's what's gonna take us all the way to the end, Morty.",Rick
"Season -- Nine more seasons, Morty. Nine more seasons until I get that dipping Szechuan sauce.",Rick
"I want that McNugget sauce, Morty!",Rick
"Don't let any of those things get away, Morty. If their DNA gets into Earth's food chain, our entire species could be sterilized.",Rick
Then why aren't we killing them?!,Morty
"Great. Next time I need a species sterilized, who's gonna do it for me? You?",Rick
"Oh, Rick! I-Is that the Vindibeacon? We're being called to assemble by the Vindicators!",Morty
"I refuse to answer a literal call to adventure, Morty. Let it go to voicemail!",Rick
"Rick, the Vindicators only call when the universe itself is at stake! They're first line of defense against evil! They're the guardians of the unguarded!",Morty
"They're the writers of their own press releases, Morty! They're a bunch of drama queens that spend an hour talking and twenty minutes jumping around while shit blows up. They're a phase. We did one, it was the big event of that summer. Let it die.",Rick
"I, Morty Smith, invoke my right to choose one in every ten Rick and Morty adventures.  Read 'em and weep.",Morty
God... fuckin' dammit!  Fine! But don't say I didn't warn you.,Rick
"Yes!  Vindicator command ship, beacon received! We're doing Vindicators Twoooooooooo!",Morty
"Whoops! Uh, Morty, you might want to freeze some sperm.",Rick
"Oh, that's Million Ants. I can't see the ants over here. It just assumed that was, uh, Turd Man. Wiggly Turd Man.",Rick
"Uh, yeah, just a few more design notes.  Um, this guy. The, uh... The, uh...",Rick
"Right, Crocubot. So, you're half-cold, unfeeling reptile, half-also cold, equally-unfeeling machine.",Rick
"So, you're origin is what? Y-You fell into a vat of redundancy?",Rick
"Well, let me check my list of powers and weaknesses. Ability to do anything... But only whenever I want... Yeah, that sounds like a job for me.",Rick
"Alan Rails, ladies and gentleman. After his parents' tragic death in a railroad accident, he gained the power to summon ghiost trains. It's not all bad, though. They were spared having to see their grown son wear a whistle!",Rick
"Thanks, Noob-Noob! This guy gets it.",Rick
"Uh, I was also late because of my drinking and metioned it to zero applause.",Rick
"Did he say ""three for three""?",Morty
Did he say he never forgets a kid?,Rick
"You mean ""two for two"", right, Vance?",Morty
"So, this is... Vindicators 3? And you guys did Vindicators 2... w-without us?",Morty
"I guess he found his crowd. Pretty toothless stuff, guys.",Rick
"I hope you're happy with the adventure so far, Morty. These guys are even lamer than last time.",Rick
"We weren't here ""last time"", remember? They did a whole Vindicators without us. A bunch of them got killed, too. They lost Lady Katana, Calypso, Diablo Verde...",Morty
"Yikes. Yeah, things did feel less diverse in there.",Rick
"This article says the reason we weren't involved was... ""personality conflicts"".",Morty
"Don't worry, Morty, they love you. Superheroes need a wide-eyed unremarkable to tag along and react to everything like it's mind-blowing.",Rick
I... think the personality conflict might have been... you.,Morty
"Jesus... How awesome is that? I mean, they wanted to not need me so bad, they murdered three innocent heroes of color, and they still had to bring me back?",Rick
"Rick, since it's my adventure and all, could you do me a favor?",Morty
"Uh, the adventure is the favor, Morty. Me sleeping on these linens is the favor. I mean, w-w-w-what--what are we vindicating? Comfort?",Rick
"Rick, this really bums me out. It-It's embarrassing to find out these guys don't like us.",Morty
"Why? Morty,  I defeat gagoos more powerful than these guys every week.",Rick
"Oh, please. They just call themselves heroes so they can...",Rick
"I'm calling them that, Rick! They're my heroes! Mine!",Morty
Huh... no accounting for taste. I'm gonna go get a drink.,Rick
I-I totally get it. I-I'm so sorry.,Morty
"Rick says ""good"" and ""bad"" are artificial constructs.",Morty
"Hey, I can't help if I can't see.",Rick
"Really? You don't say. You would have used a ghost train?  Hey, everybody, the ghost train guy would have used a ghost train!",Rick
"Is there coffee? Hey, Morty, can you be a pal? Grandpa left his coffee maker on the ship. Y-You know, the French press thing?",Rick
"Little extra  snippy this morning, aren't you?",Rick
"Just focus on the mission, all right?",Morty
"Oh, oh, oh, I'm sorry. Oh, you're right. Ooh, real serious. Gotta take it real serious, huh?",Rick
"Ooh, real scared. Real fucking on alert, high alwrt over here.",Rick
"Million Ants, ladies and gentleman! The ant colony with the power of two human eyes!",Rick
"All right. Short mission, good mission. Remember when Alan wanted to use a ghost train? See you guys in Vindicators 4. Morty?",Rick
"Rick, whoever did this is an even bigger threat than Worldender! We can't leave now!",Morty
"Well, have fun with that. But Morty and I have to meet a comet girl, a monorail man, two assholes and a full alligator in, like, an hour.",Rick
"Welp, it's official. I had too much to drink last night.",Rick
"Obviously, I came here last night during a blackout.",Rick
"Look, I'm a lit-- little more complex than you guys and, no offense, but I've always suspected that a lot of what you do in a year could be knocked out in a couple of hours.",Rick
"Rick, is-is this a ""Saw"" thing? Are you seriously ""Saw""-ing the Vindicators?",Morty
"Morty I'm a drunk, not a hack.",Rick
"Well, I-I-I think we've seen enough. I'll just figure out how to unplug this.",Rick
"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on, Vance. He said you'd die if you tried to leave. That means there's booby traps.",Rick
"What part of ""blackout"" don't you understand? I thought you drank?",Rick
Because my epidermis is laced with a nanofiber defense mesh.,Rick
"And because, like I said, I don't remember last night.",Rick
"Alan, I'm not proud of what's happening here, but if you keep coming at me, there's gonna be another passenger on that ghost train.",Rick
Guys!  I've figured it out.,Morty
It was a bit. All of the descriptors apply to all of you. Drunk Rick's point is that none of you are very special or different.  That's always his point.,Morty
The two of us?!  I hope you're proud of yourself!,Morty
"Uh, I kind of am. I saved the goddamn universe.",Rick
"Ahh, it would've been if I hadn't.",Rick
"Huh, I'm seeing more croc than bot here.",Rick
"Uh, what happened on Dorian 5?",Morty
"You know,  I could have made a device to detect Doomnomitron from orbit like  that.",Rick
I-It's just something Rick starts talking about whenever he's blackout drunk.,Morty
"W-What? In w--In w-w-what--In what way? Like, w-w-what's my point?",Rick
"In a way that has no point! You just babble about defense budgets and the United Nations, and then you pass out!",Morty
"So, to be clear, I sometimes reference the geopolitical complexities of the topic, which is not the same as going to an anti-Semitic place.",Rick
"I don't either. I-I'm just saying, if anything, the drunk version of me is probably so supportive of Israel, he wants what's best for it and...",Rick
"You guys hit the baskets. I'll disarm the drunkenly-improvised neutrino bomb. There's a 40% chance it's a dud, but y-you should still stay back.",Morty
"Man, I am really getting high-roaded today.",Rick
Where the fuck is the lead wire?!,Rick
"You always put it in the weirdest place! Um, uh, over here, maybe?",Morty
"Jesus Christ, what a shitty neutrino bomb. it's a miracle I actually every destroy anything.",Rick
"Oh, I don't know. You managed to destroy just about everything today; the villains, the heroes, the lines between them, my childhood...",Morty
"Thank you. I appreciate it, Morty. I know you were sucking the Kool-Aid out of the Vindicators' dicks, so the fact that I was right about them must be pretty hard to admit.",Rick
"Yeah, it is. You know why, Rick? Because when you're an asshole, it doesn't matter how right you are, nobody wants to give you the satisfaction.",Morty
"I know. Everyone wants people they like to be right. That's why popular people are fucking dumb. And why your pretentious, poorly-written, high-budget friends back there can a eat a double-decker shit sandwich.  Disarmed.",Rick
"Guys, stop! You're just proving my asshole grandpa right!",Morty
"Oh, come on, maybe a couple of them, but definitely not the train guy.",Rick
"I think... no matter what we put on there, we die. he said it's the part of the Vindicators he values. That means nothing. He wants our last moment alive to be spent knowing how few fucks he gave.",Morty
"Hey, I don't know. I mean, look, when I get drunk, I get stupid and emotional and there's no logic to it. it's, like, possible I got so drunk, I felt like I was losing Morty to the Vindicators, and maybe this is my way of saying ""Okay, you can have him, but only if you know how important he is, otherwise I'll kill you.""",Rick
"Look, I... there's nothing in the room but us. I'm just using logic to connect some dots. It's the best guess I've got.",Rick
I'll cover that bet. I get it.,Morty
"Well, Morty, I think you're making that smirky face because you're misinterpreting the moment. I am not being coy about some hidden love for you. I want to be really clear that, if anyone has a better guess, like, if I gave you an amulet last night, or...",Rick
No doubt. Who do we make the check out to?,Morty
"I'll say, we are gettin' some good licks in while choking to death.",Rick
"Look at that. Geez, I must've planned a whole party. Invited a bunch of people. Not bad, Drunk Rick, not bad.",Rick
But.. she was trying to kill us!,Morty
"Morty, twenty people try to kill me every week. I end up getting high with half of 'em. I mean, check it out, Gear Head's here.",Rick
"Morty, you're wearing a Vindicator jacket. Are you a little superhero now?",Beth
"Everyone in the universe is a hero, Mom. Which is why we don't need jackets.  And I'm pretty sure we don't need Vindicators.",Morty
"Man, Grandpa Rick must have gotten shitfaced.",Summer
