"Yeah, and once those seeds wear off, you're gonna lose most of your motor skills, and you're also gonna lose a significant amount of brain functionality for 72 hours, Morty.",Rick,Morty
"What? N-No, I don't want to see your Pog collection. I don't renounce Rick, and I never have. I was just trying to protect my sister. I wanted you to have a normal life. That's something you can't have when Rick shows up. Everything real turns fake. Everything right is wrong. All you know is that you know nothing and he knows everything. And, well -- well, he's not a villain, Summer, but he shouldn't be your hero. He's more like a demon or a super fucked up god.",Morty,Riq IV
"But I obviously sort of love you, don't I?  So stop asking and maybe I'll love you more.  Crap, They need me at the horse hospital.",Beth,Jerry
"Oh, my God! He's trying to tell us something.  That is so awesome.",Summer,Snuffles
What are you trying to say about Morty? That he's stupid or something?,Rick,Jerry
"Yeah, and what's courageous about eating a hot dog?",Morty,Summer
"Now hold on a second, let’s be rational about this.",Beth,Principal Vagina
"Obviously, I came here last night during a blackout.",Rick,Vance
You stole a time freezing crystal from testical monsters?,Summer,Testicle Monster A
"Morty! Good music comes from people who are relaxed. Just hit a button, Morty! Gimme a beat!",Rick,Morty
"Oh, please. They just call themselves heroes so they can...",Rick,Morty
"I'm really hoping it wasn't a one-off thing and I can see her again. By the way, hey, um... still not curious about what might've happened at that crazy Citadel place?",Morty,Rick
"Oh, my God. He's not bluffing. He's not bluffing!",Summer,Rick
"It's been six hours. Dreams move one one-hundredth the speed of reality, and dog time is one-seventh human time. So, you know, every day here is like a minute. It's like ""Inception,"" Morty, so if it's confusing and stupid, then so is everyone's favorite movie.",Rick,Morty
"Jerry, if you're not gonna help, get the fuck out of here! I will reach into heaven and yank your screaming deer soul back!",Beth,Jerry
"The Pentagon. I mean, not THE Pentagon.  The lame one, here on Earth.",Rick,Morty
"Negative visualization, Jerry. It explains a lot about where you're at. Hi, sweety.",Rick,Jerry
Oh my God! C-c-can you fly a Blackhawk?,Morty,President
You’re gonna wanna put them on that giant speaker system at your sonic testing facility at Area 51.,Rick,President
"You know, that's a real comforting idea, Rick.",Morty,Rick
Guys!  I've figured it out.,Morty,Rick
"I got a surprise for you, Morty.",Rick,Morty
"Look, I appreciate the stress you're under, but Morty was having trouble in school way before my dad moved in, and the only influence I can see Rick having is that, for the first time in his life, Morty has a friend.",Beth,Jerry
"Oh man. I love you too, Jessica!",Morty,Jessica
"Wait a minute. I have an idea. Gentlemen, a moment of your time.  See that? I'm peeing all over your special guns. That means I own them.",Jerry,Rick
"Eh, Try not to worry about it, Morty. You're a good kid, and there's not a premium on that right now, but you'll be getting girls sometime after Brad's out of shape.",Jerry,Brad
"All right, Morty, time to make our move.",Rick,Mrs. Pancakes
"Beth, do you still love me?",Jerry,Rick
"Summer, you're freaking me out. I know things have changed a lot, and I know you miss Rick, but getting him back wouldn't make things better. And, you know, we're not doing so bad.",Morty,Summer
"Yeah, Rick, I get it. We're surrounded by monsters. That's kind of the reason why I want to leave.",Morty,Rick
"Y-You want to see what a hero Rick is? I-I'll bring you somewhere, Summer. Um-",Morty,Summer
"Whoa! What is this on the floor? Some kind of literature for a really nice-looking nursing home. Hey, honey, crazy idea bad pitch let's put your dad here. Let's put your dad in a nursing home.",Jerry,Jerry
"Yeah it would literally destroy them. Now listen, why do—why do—why—why don't you guys go get a free sunday ice cream,  go out there and get some ice creams. Here's five hundred dollars cash in unmarked moneys. I'm just gonna put it on the floor and uh, kick it on over to ya. You guys go nuts.",Rick,Summer
I don't know. It's Indian giving.,Summer,Jerry
"That's what's gonna take us all the way to the end, Morty.",Rick,Morty
"My marriage is fine, thank you.",Jerry,Rick
"Hi, honey, so, here's the thing-these guys-they want to completely remove my penis and use it as an alien's heart, and we just need you to sign off on it.",Jerry,Alien Doctor
"Put them way up inside there, as far as they can fit.",Rick,Morty
"You gotta be careful Morty, if that guy catches you with a box of his eye-holes he comes bursting in through a window and just starts kicking the shit outta you. But it's worth the risk, they melt in your mouth Morty! They're delicious.",Rick,Announcer
"Yeah, this is a bunch of bullcrap. Who cares what stupid pun you make when you kill someone? Why don't you let the poor guy say whatever he wants?",Rick,Scary Terry
"Thanks, Morty. Yeah, it's nice to be on the same page every once in a while.",Rick,Morty
"Dad, what do you know about this?",Beth,Jerry
No doubt. Who do we make the check out to?,Morty,Rick
"He's saying ""I love Obama"".  So cute! I'm posting this  online, like, right now.",Summer,Snuffles
"You'll never get away with this, Concerto.",Rick,Rick
"There's ways to get back home, Morty. It's just it's just gonna be a little bit of a hassle. We're gonna have to go through interdimensional customs, so you're gonna have to do me a real solid.",Rick,Morty
"Alright, Morty, whoever you smear this stuff on will fall in love with you, and only you, forever. Ya happy now, Morty?",Rick,Morty
"It's a device, Morty, that when you put it in your ear, you can enter people's dreams, Morty. It's just like that movie that you keep crowing about.",Rick,Morty
"I'm taking charge of this situation, buddy!  I'm put—I’m, I'm, I'm, I'm puttin’... I-I’m, I’m, I’m not gonna stand around like some sort of dumb... dumb person and just le-let you ruin the whole world!",Morty,Rick
"Look, I know I was kind of a nuisance today. I know it's my fault we hit the deer, and I know you wanted to be the one to save it.",Jerry,Testicle Monster A
"Jerry, do you want homeless people to have homes?",Beth,Jerry
"I need to type in the coordinates to our home world, Morty. Cover me.",Rick,Morty
"Geez! Are my parents seriously gonna get divorced? All right, Rick, I'm gonna go to my --",Morty,Summer
"Don't let any of those things get away, Morty. If their DNA gets into Earth's food chain, our entire species could be sterilized.",Rick,
"Holy crap, Morty. He can travel through dreams. He can travel through dreams! We're so screwed!",Rick,Morty
What are you doing with that?!,Morty,Morty
"He won't have to ask for it, okay? He won't need it. He'll just make more. He doesn't need anything from anyone.",Beth,Dr. Wong
"Ooh! Oh, nice, Morty! The student becomes the teacher.",Rick,Rick
"Don't worry, Morty, they love you. Superheroes need a wide-eyed unremarkable to tag along and react to everything like it's mind-blowing.",Rick,Morty
"Jerry, please tell me you're here for an incredibly urgent reason.",Beth,Jerry
That's my sister. This used to be my home.,Morty,Summer
"Jerry, what the hell is happening?!",Beth,Mr. Goldenfold
"That means they're good ones. You're a good kid, Morty. Those mega seeds are super valuable to my work. You've been a huge help to me. I'm gonna be able to do a-",Rick,Morty
"Shut up Morty, you vindictive little turd!",Summer,Morty
"Ahh, it would've been if I hadn't.",Rick,Morty
I-I-I don't know what you mean by that. Can can can you be a little bit more specific?,Rick,Beth
"Sweety, is your shirt on backwards?",Beth,Jerry
You lied! You lied about the charge! You were just being lazy! Get back! Sit down!,Morty,Rick
"Oh, no, Morty. His subconscious is panicking.",Rick,Mr. Goldenfold
W-We just missed you a lot.,Morty,Beth
Our time is gonna be unstable? What does that even mean?,Morty,Rick
"That's the point of pottery-enamel huffing, Summer. You do it so you don't have to say ""I'm angry at mommy"" out loud.",Beth,Summer
"Huh, I'm seeing more croc than bot here.",Rick,Supernova
Dad I would like you to tell me what's in the syringe.,Beth,Pickle Rick
"Well, have fun with that. But Morty and I have to meet a comet girl, a monorail man, two assholes and a full alligator in, like, an hour.",Rick,Supernova
"They're the writers of their own press releases, Morty! They're a bunch of drama queens that spend an hour talking and twenty minutes jumping around while shit blows up. They're a phase. We did one, it was the big event of that summer. Let it die.",Rick,Morty
I say…  Let’s do it!,Rick,Morty
"What? I do, I squanch my family.",Beth,Beth
"Really? Like, go somewhere? Yeah, let's drop the kids off and go tie one on.",Beth,Rick
"I want that ""Mulan"" McNugget sauce, Morty! That's my series arc, Morty.",Rick,Morty
"That's it... that's it, Rick. I'm taking the wheel.",Morty,Rick
"Summer, nobody has to know about that. We could put it right back and pretend we never saw it, like we did with Dad's mannequin leg.",Morty,Young Rick
"Hey, I don't know. I mean, look, when I get drunk, I get stupid and emotional and there's no logic to it. it's, like, possible I got so drunk, I felt like I was losing Morty to the Vindicators, and maybe this is my way of saying ""Okay, you can have him, but only if you know how important he is, otherwise I'll kill you.""",Rick,Morty
"You said the same thing, equally sarcastically, at our wedding and guess what?",Jerry,Jerry
"Yes, we're back to our own time.",Summer,Rick
Because we're both rational adults that don't want anything bad to happen. And because I have a human shield.,Rick,Rick
Temporarily. By order of the school.,Beth,Mr. Goldenfold
Looks like some sort of legally safe knock-off of an '80s horror character with miniature swords for fingers instead of knives.,Rick,Morty
"Ahhh, well,  I remember feeling that way about a young lady named your mom, and that's not an urban dis, your mom was my Jessica. I remember the first time I saw her, I thought...",Jerry,Morty
"Oh, my God. Nancy says they're drawing and quartering aliens in the school courtyard, and it technically counts as patriotism.",Summer,Beth
"Www.. what am I, a hack?! Go nuts, Morty, it's full proof.",Rick,Morty
"Yes no more cats, no more cats, oh you did it, you fixed it.",Morty,Summer
"Oh, it's fine. I mean, thank you, and, yeah, you shouldn't. But I hope you know that's not what that session was supposed to be.",Beth,Pickle Rick
"I don't care about prosthetics, this is insane! What do you people think you're doing?",Beth,Alien Doctor
Why would you keep mutant bacteria in a pint of Cherry Garcia?,Beth,Rick
I'm not letting you let my sister die! Drop the gun!,Morty,Rick
You guys should really not be touching that stuff. It's beyond your reasoning.,Rick,Rick
"No, no, that happened before you went to sleep, Morty. You're sleeping in your crap right now. Out of all the things that happened to you, that was the only real thing that, you know, is that you crapped your pants. I mean, it's a mess out there. I got some on my hands, Morty, and then I got it on the dream inceptor, and a piece fell in my mouth.",Rick,Morty
"She huffed enamel, and we never even talked about it.",Beth,Pickle Rick
I better tend to Jerry before he changes his mind and doesn't move out. I will leave you two to your adventures.,Beth,Beth
"Oh, boy, Rick. I can only imagine what horrible things must, you know scare Scary Terry.",Morty,Rick
"Oh, absolutely. Beth is automatically on board, always, with every decision I make.",Jerry,Alien Doctor
Because my epidermis is laced with a nanofiber defense mesh.,Rick,Alan
"I know this isn't the time, but, you know, technically the second freezer drawer is mine.",Rick,Beth
"Why? Morty,  I defeat gagoos more powerful than these guys every week.",Rick,Morty
"All right, Ruffles What's his name?",Rick,Rick
"Uh, did we ever put that mattress under Mr. Benson?",Morty,Rick
"Oh, Rick! I-Is that the Vindibeacon? We're being called to assemble by the Vindicators!",Morty,Rick
"When I drop the bomb you know, I want you to have somebody, you know? I want you to have the thing. I'm gonna make it like a new Adam and Eve, and you're gonna be Adam.",Rick,Morty
"Uh, yeah, maybe I am. I'm my father's daughter. I'm smart. Why do you think I'm a heart surgeon?",Beth,Jerry
If we hurry we can set up camp in a sewer tunnel or something before the dogs completely take over.,Rick,Morty
"The racetrack had a starlit derby, there's a seven horse collision, and Davin's there alone.",Beth,Jerry
Stop saying his name! He abandoned us.,Beth,Summer
That’s my dream! That’s my dream.,Beth,Principal Vagina
"I don't like it here, Morty. I can't abide bureaucracy. I don't like being told where to go and what to do. I consider it a violation. Did you get those seeds all the way up your butt?",Rick,Announcer
"A hair, Morty, I need one of your hairs! This isn't Game Of Thrones.",Rick,Morty
"But I feel like one of the sixty-four Ricks like, sacrificed himself for me, maybe, I think.",Morty,Rick
"I want that McNugget sauce, Morty!",Rick,Morty
"Ughhhh... belchflies towards front doorTurning back around and re-entering dining roomScoffsHovers over Jerry and fully shoves him into underside before flying away through open front door and into skyRuns to front doorFollow BethLooking into skyStill eating cerealUnscrewing and drinking from scotch flaskMorty waveskissing Beth's handHolding a suit in a dry cleaning bag* Your language has 'squanch,' in it a lot. Doesn't that become tedious and worn out like the Smurf thing?",Rick,Summer
"I think it will be great, Morty. You know it could be developed in-into a very satisfying project for people of all ages. I mean, I'd watch it, Morty, for at least 11 minutes a pop. You know, may-maybe they'll do it board-driven.",Rick,Morty
"Look, d-d-d-don't worry about it, Morty. Here, here take these, Morty. Take these.",Rick,Morty
"There you are, Morty. Listen to me. I got an errand to run in a whole different dimension. I need an extra pair of hands.",Rick,Morty
"Rick, the Vindicators only call when the universe itself is at stake! They're first line of defense against evil! They're the guardians of the unguarded!",Morty,Rick
"Are you listening to me, Morty? Homework is stupid. The whole point is to get less of it.",Rick,Morty
"It's a, it's a rodent that mates for life, Morty. This is the chemical release in the mammal's brain,  ...that makes it fall in love. Alright Morty, I just gotta  combine it with some of your DNA.",Rick,Rick
"Oh, Jerry. You mean because it had dogs in it.",Beth,Jerry
"You always put it in the weirdest place! Um, uh, over here, maybe?",Morty,Rick
"Oh, I don't know. You managed to destroy just about everything today; the villains, the heroes, the lines between them, my childhood...",Morty,Rick
"Morty, this is perfect. After a little scary coitus, they should be fast asleep and then we'll incept him.",Rick,Scary Terry
"Okay, Snowball, just calm down, okay? You're scaring me.",Summer,Snuffles
"Look, I'm a lit-- little more complex than you guys and, no offense, but I've always suspected that a lot of what you do in a year could be knocked out in a couple of hours.",Rick,Supernova
"Excuse me, nurse, can you take my temperature? Because I think I have Jan Quadrant Vincent fever over here.",Morty,Rick
"I thought the whole point of having a dog was to feel superior, Jerry. If I were you, I wouldn't pull that thread. Come on, Morty.",Rick,Jerry
"Aw, man. I really liked this life. Well, at least I didn't really crap my pants.",Morty,Rick
I think planet Earth has just been transported.,Rick,President
"Morty, just put it down. You don’t know what you’re doing.",Rick,Morty
What new-  what new machine?,Rick,Rick
"Jerry, I don't want whatever's happening here to stop.",Beth,Rick
"Uh, what happened on Dorian 5?",Morty,Supernova
"Oh yes, yes! Rise to the giant head! You are free to be free!",Summer,Principal Vagina
"Come on, Rick, don't talk about my parents like that.",Morty,Rick
"That, Morty, is why you don't go to therapy.",Rick,Morty
Stop saying it like it’s a thing! You made it up!,Morty,Rick
"Wow. Well, okay, Jessica. L-let's give this a shot.",Morty,Jessica
"Oh, man. I mean, you know, I-I don't want to shoot nobody.",Morty,Rick
"Oh, God! Oh, God! Whoa, whoa!",Morty,Morty
"He threatened to turn me in to the government, so I made him and the government go away.",Rick,Morty
What?! Are you kidding me?! Ohhhhhh!,Morty,Rick
"You know what, Morty? You're right.  Let's forget the girl altogether. She, she's probably nothing but trouble, anyways.",Rick,Morty
"Yeah, well, since when are we taking this guy's advice on anything?",Rick,Morty
"Don't be a baby! You avoid getting shot in real life all the time, Morty. Just do the same thing here, and we'll be fine!",Rick,Morty
"Yeah, Morty, if you like that, boy, you're you're really going to flip your lid over this one.",Rick,Morty
"Well, I-I-I think we've seen enough. I'll just figure out how to unplug this.",Rick,Drunk Rick
"Well, Morty, I think you're making that smirky face because you're misinterpreting the moment. I am not being coy about some hidden love for you. I want to be really clear that, if anyone has a better guess, like, if I gave you an amulet last night, or...",Rick,Morty
Geez. I didn’t know there were still Ricks and Mortys living on the Citadel. I wonder what their day-to-day lives are like.,Morty,Rick
"Yeah me neither, we pretty much nailed it the first time.",Rick,Rick
"Yeah,  you see, I try to shelter you from certain realities,  Morty. Cause if I let you make me nervous, then we can’t get schwifty.",Rick,Morty
"Oh, it gets darker, Morty. Welcome to the darkest year of our adventures. First thing that's different -- no more Dad, Morty.",Rick,Morty
"Hey, I like being 35. I-I can rent a car now.",Morty,Summer
Hold your fire! Hold your fire! I'm Morty C-137.,Morty,Morty
"Oh, geez, Rick, that's not good. W-what are we gonna do? I-I have to be back at school right now. How are we gonna get back home?",Morty,Rick
"Great. Next time I need a species sterilized, who's gonna do it for me? You?",Rick,Morty
Close. It's gonna make your kidneys shut down.,Rick,Morty
Take off your pants and your panties Shit on the floor Time to get schwifty in here I’m Mr. Bulldops,Rick,President
What the fuck? You can turn into ice?,Rick,Ice-T
I-I'm just trying to figure out why you would do this. Why anyone would do this.,Morty,Pickle Rick
"Thank you. This is all so overwhelming, but, uh… we can’t.",Jerry,Beth
"This is it, Morty. We're goners. We're not getting out of this one. After everything we've been through, this is how we're gonna die. Make peace with your god.",Rick,Rick
"Yeah, I'd like to get a 10-piece McNugget and a bunch of the Szechuan sauce. Like, as much as you're allowed to give me. In 1998, they had this promotion for the Disney film ""Mulan,"" where they -- where they -- they created a new sauce for the McNuggets called Szechuan sauce, and it's delicious! And then they got rid of it, and now it's gone. This is the only place we're gonna be able to try it, is in my memory.",Rick,Rick
What the hell? Why would Mr. Goldenfold's dream version of Mrs.,Morty,Rick
This is what I'm talking about. This is a dog.,Jerry,Summer
"I'll say, we are gettin' some good licks in while choking to death.",Rick,Morty
"Yeah, it is. You know why, Rick? Because when you're an asshole, it doesn't matter how right you are, nobody wants to give you the satisfaction.",Morty,Rick
"It's all over, Jerry. The dogs are on a path to total world domination. But, hey, at least they know not to piss on your carpet, right?",Rick,Jerry
"Listen, Morty, I hate to break it to you, but what people call ""love"" is a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed. It hits hard, Morty, then it slowly fades, leaving you stranded in a failing marriage. I did it, your parents are gonna do it. Break the cycle, Morty. Rise above. Focus on science.",Rick,Morty
To the day it all began and ended. The moment that changed everything.,Rick,Cornvelious Daniel
"Ooh, or -- or reprogram their military portals to disintegrate their entire space fleet?",Morty,Summer
"Morty. I had to... I had to do it. I had— I had to— I had to make a bomb, Morty. I had to create a bomb.",Rick,Morty
"Look, I-I'm not proud to share this, but the truth is, I just kept crawling, and it kept working.  Oh, I'm glad you're okay. Are we ever going to stop paying for indulging your father? Our children, our planet, our jobs? Is there anything left to lose?",Jerry,Beth
"Alright fine, but you're not touching my CRISPR.",Rick,Rick
"Morty, that's such a poor use of my time, it's beneath me. Hand me the screwdriver.",Rick,Morty
"We weren't here ""last time"", remember? They did a whole Vindicators without us. A bunch of them got killed, too. They lost Lady Katana, Calypso, Diablo Verde...",Morty,Rick
Huh? What are you -- What are you doing?,Morty,Rick
"Well, can we at least go get our family? You know, so we can take them with-with-with us if we lose?",Morty,Rick
"You have dropped so many balls, man. Do you ever get scared Grampa Rick might make me his new sidekick?",Summer,Morty
"Morty, twenty people try to kill me every week. I end up getting high with half of 'em. I mean, check it out, Gear Head's here.",Rick,Morty
"Well, you might as well order some pancakes, because I don't see the need to leave this part of my brain.",Rick,Cornvelious Daniel
"Are you joking me? I mean, look at all the crazy crap surrounding us. Look at that thing right there.  What the hell is that thing? You think you're gonna see that kind of thing at school?  Look at it just lumbering around.  It defies all logic, that thing.",Rick,Morty
"True, but you can alter anything you want about a totally fabricated origin story.",Rick,Cornvelious Daniel
"Oh man, ok, all right, um…",Morty,Rick
"We’ve been waiting 16 years for our daughter to respect us, but the key is, it has to be “our” daughter, not this person she’s become.",Beth,Principal Vagina
"Emotionally speaking, honey, Shoney's is my home.",Rick,Beth
"ooo... Watch out for that stuff. It'll stain if it gets on your clothes, and it'll send into a murderous rage if it gets in your eyes or mouth.",Rick,Morty
"It's pretty obvious, Morty. I froze him. Now listen I need your help, Morty. I mean, we got we got to get get the hell out of here and go take care of business.  It's important. Come on, Morty.",Rick,Morty
"Well you're thirty-nine years too late, or however old he is. Is he fifty? Oh man, Beth is, is Jerry fifity!?",Rick,Beth
"Yeah, it’s possible that we may have been correlating some things that weren’t actually related at all.",Jerry,Mr. Goldenfold
"Rick, did you do this on purpose to get out of family counseling?",Morty,Pickle Rick
"Hey, you know what? You got a really good point there, Rick. Like, if the truth was that we could hide, it's not like he'd be sharing that information with us, you know? I-I-I think it's a good idea, Rick.",Morty,Rick
"Well, somebody's got to do it, Morty. Th-these seeds aren't gonna get through customs unless they're in someone's rectum, Morty",Rick,Morty
"What, I'm gonna touch it, and you're gonna tell me it's an alien dick or something.",Morty,Pickle Rick
"Here’s yours!  Mom, do you mind if I cook dinner tonight?",Summer,Jerry
"It's a dream, Morty. We're in your dog's dream. The night the dogs captured us, after you cried and crapped your pants, we all went to sleep. Then I used my dream inceptors to put the two of us inside snuffles' dream.",Rick,Morty
"Morty, take this. You're gonna need it later.",Rick,Morty
"Well, it's lunch. I mean, it's one of three meals that have existed for millennia.",Jerry,Beth
"Whoops! Uh, Morty, you might want to freeze some sperm.",Rick,Morty
And how are you gonna do that?,Morty,Summer
"Morty, you're wearing a Vindicator jacket. Are you a little superhero now?",Beth,Rick
"Boom! In your face Summer! You really dropped the ball, man.",Morty,Rick
"Summer, Morty, take off your collars!",Rick,Testicle Monster A
"Okay, yeah. I get what Beth was talking about. Fun's over.",Jerry,Snuffles
"Are you kidding me?! That's it, Rick! That's the last straw! I can't believe this! I'm sitting here with both of my legs broken, and you're still asking me about getting those seeds?! Ooh! Ow! Oh! Y-y-you're a monster. Y-you're like Hitler, but-but even Hitler cared about Germany or something.",Morty,Rick
"I mean, Jerry, y-you didn't explain the full gravity of the situation.",Beth,Alien Doctor
"Or let her go, which I will reward with a quicker death.",Rick,Summer
Ooh! Ohh! Ooh! Hnngh! Hoo! Ooh! Ohh! Aaaaagh! Oooooh!,Morty,Rick
"Guys, stop! You're just proving my asshole grandpa right!",Morty,Drunk Rick
I-It's just something Rick starts talking about whenever he's blackout drunk.,Morty,Supernova
"You guys hit the baskets. I'll disarm the drunkenly-improvised neutrino bomb. There's a 40% chance it's a dud, but y-you should still stay back.",Morty,Drunk Rick
"Pssh! Not at all, Morty. That place will never have any bearing over our lives ever again. Unlike that mermaid puss! Yeah!! We're going back for seconds! We're gonna do that shit every week, man! That was Atlantis!",Rick,Morty
"Whoa, dad, you can't, like, endow a creature with sentience and then rip it away.",Summer,Jerry
"It's a figure of speech, Morty. They're bureaucrats. I don't respect them. Just keep shooting, Morty. You have no idea what prison is like here!",Rick,Morty
Who cares how high they promote you? Everyone just gets paid in pills.,Summer,Jerry
"Oh, geez, Rick. W-w-whoa, this isn't good.",Morty,Rick
"Relax, Morty. Look! Mrs. Pancakes has a parachute. Come on!",Rick,Morty
"You don't have to try to impress me, Morty. Listen, tonight we're gonna go into the home of your math teacher, Mr. Goldenfold, and we're gonna incept the idea in his brain to give you A's in math, Morty. That way you can, you know, y-you're gonna help me with my science, Morty, all the time.",Rick,Morty
"YOU KNOW WHAT, NO RICK! I'M NOT GONNA HAND YOU THE SCREWDRIVER! Uh, I'm never gonna hand you anything ever again, Rick.  I'm always helping you with this and that and the other thing. Www...what about me, Rick? Www... why can't you just help me out once, once, for once?",Morty,Rick
Require different levels of skill to keep alive?,Beth,Jerry
"Dad, how could you make my son miss an entire semester of school? I mean, it's not like he's a hot girl. He can't just bail on his life and set up shop in someone else's.",Beth,Rick
How long exactly do we have to wear these things? They're really embarassing.,Rick,Testicle Monster A
My kids pee their desks and suck on unbaked vases.,Beth,Dr. Wong
My name is Rick Sanchez. This here’s my grandson Morty.,Rick,President
"We’re so proud of you. But honestly, you don’t have to make dinner every night.",Jerry,Beth
"Geez, Rick, in the time it took you to make this thing, couldn't you have just, you know, helped me with my homework?",Morty,Rick
"I guess he found his crowd. Pretty toothless stuff, guys.",Rick,Vance
"You know,  I could have made a device to detect Doomnomitron from orbit like  that.",Rick,Morty
You’re going to be ok!  You will come back as babies!,Summer,Jerry
Sure! Let’s go to the Ascension. Wh-wh-what is it?,Jerry,Summer
"Morty, we just got him back!",Summer,Morty
"Not so fast, Morty. You heard your mom. We've got adventures to go on, Morty -- just you and me -- and sometimes your sister and sometimes your mom, but never your dad. You want to know why, Morty? Because he crossed me.",Rick,Morty

"I'm sorry, Morty. It's a bummer. In reality, you're as dumb as they come and I needed those seeds real bad, and I had to give them up just to get your parents off my back, so now we're gonna have to go get more adventures.  And then we're gonna go on even more adventures after that, Morty and you're gonna keep your mouth shut about it, Morty, because the world is full of idiots that don't understand what's important, and they'll tear us apart, Morty but if you stick with me, I'm gonna accomplish great things, Morty, and you're gonna be part of them, and together, we're gonna run around, Morty. We're gonna do all kinds of wonderful things, Morty. Just you and me, Morty. The outside world is our enemy, Morty. We're the only friends we've got, Morty. It's just Rick and Morty.

"Whoa! Hey, buddy. What you got going on there?",Jerry,Scary Terry
"Ready as I’ll ever be, Rick!",Morty,Rick

"Morty I'm a drunk, not a hack.",Rick,Morty

"Yeah, he knows. He murdered them.",Morty,Morty
"You ask a lot of questions, Morty. Not very charismatic. It makes you kind of an  under-  underfoot figure.",Rick,Morty
"Welp, it's official. I had too much to drink last night.",Rick,Drunk Rick
"Oh, don't high-road us, dad. You know fully well that Morty is the last child that needs to be missing classes.",Beth,Rick

"And so that's the surprise, Morty.",Rick,Morty
"Oh, okay... I squanch my family.",Beth,Rick

We're moving you to a nursing home.,Beth,Rick
"Enough. Kids, it's time to go. We don't want to be late.",Beth,Pickle Rick
"Don't make my mistake, Summer. Don't deify the people that leave you. You'll end up a horse surgeon in a world controlled by aliens whose medicine keeps horses  healthy forever.  Horses live longer than tortoises now. Is that what you want for yourself?",Beth,Jerry
"Did he say ""three for three""?",Morty,Vance
"Summer, show your father some respect. He's pulling down a six-chewable figure income.",Beth,Jerry

"Listen, Jerry. I-I-I don't want to overstep my bounds or anything. It's your house. It's your world. You're a real Julius Caesar but I'll tell you something—tell you how I feel about school, Jerry. It's a waste of time.  Buncha people running around, bumping into each other. G-guy up front says, ""two plus two."" The people in the back say, ""four."" Then the—then the bell rings, and they give you a carton of milk and a piece of paper that says you can go take a dump or something. I mean, it's not a place for smart people, Jerry. And I know that's not a popular opinion, but it's my two cents on the issue.  This was a good breakfast, Beth. You really made the crap out of those eggs. I wish your mother was here to eat them.",Rick,Jerry
Then why aren't we killing them?!,Morty,Rick
"Wh-What do you think, Ice? Probably a little over-developed.",Rick,Birdperson
Do you really not see what's happening here?,Beth,Dr. Wong
"Well, duh doy, son. Look, I love you, Morty, but we both know you're not as fast as the other kids, and if you want to compete in this world, you got to work twice as hard.",Jerry,Morty
"You're a serious fuckin' idiot, Morty! You basically killed us all! You're the worst! You're as dumb as a bag of sand.",Rick,Summer
Huh! You think you can control me with a haircut?,Jerry,Snuffles

"Grandpa Rick must have some secret lab, right? With, like, laser guns and jets packs and a space tank! And we can go break him out of prison! Look at these dead flies! Maybe if we arrange them in a certain order, it plays a hologram or it opens a secret door.",Summer,Morty
